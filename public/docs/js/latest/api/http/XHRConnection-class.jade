  Creates connections using `XMLHttpRequest`. Given a fully-qualified
  request, an `XHRConnection` will immediately create an `XMLHttpRequest` object and send the
  request.
  
  This class would typically not be created or interacted with directly inside applications, though
  the <a href='MockConnection-class.html'><code>MockConnection</code></a> may be interacted with in tests.
