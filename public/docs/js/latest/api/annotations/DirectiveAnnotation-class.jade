  Directives allow you to attach behavior to elements in the DOM.
  
  <a href='Directive-var.html'><code>Directive</code></a>s with an embedded view are called <a href='Component-var.html'><code>Component</code></a>s.
  
  A directive consists of a single directive annotation and a controller class. When the
  directive's `selector` matches
  elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:
  
  1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor
  arguments.
  2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a
  depth-first order,
     as declared in the HTML.
  
  ## Understanding How Injection Works
  
  There are three stages of injection resolution.
  - *Pre-existing Injectors*:
    - The terminal <a href='../di/Injector-class.html'><code>Injector</code></a> cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if
  the dependency was
      specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.
    - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,
  location, and others.
  - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own <a href='../di/Injector-class.html'><code>Injector</code></a>, and they follow
  the same parent-child hierarchy
      as the component instances in the DOM.
  - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each
  element has an `ElementInjector`
      which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.
  
  When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a
  depth-first order. The
  current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.
  
  Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the
  <a href='View-var.html'><code>View</code></a>:
  
  1. Dependencies on the current element
  2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary
  3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component
  4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors
  
  
  The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can
  delegate to the parent
  injector.
  
  To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:
  - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only
  - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current
  element and the
     Shadow DOM root.
  - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child
  directives.
  - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any
  child directives.
  
  To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:
  - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.
  - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for
  <a href='Directive-var.html'><code>Directive</code></a> directives only
  - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.
  
  ## Example
  
  The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in
  practice.
  
  
  Assume this HTML template:
  
  ```
  <div dependency="1">
    <div dependency="2">
      <div dependency="3" my-directive>
        <div dependency="4">
          <div dependency="5"></div>
        </div>
        <div dependency="6"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  ```
  
  With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.
  
  ```
  @Injectable()
  class SomeService {
  }
  
  @Directive({
    selector: '[dependency]',
    properties: [
      'id: dependency'
    ]
  })
  class Dependency {
    id:string;
  }
  ```
  
  Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...
  
  
  ### No injection
  
  Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into
  `MyDirective`.
  
  ```
  @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
  class MyDirective {
    constructor() {
    }
  }
  ```
  
  This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.
  
  
  ### Component-level injection
  
  Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its
  parents.
  
  Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type
  from the parent
  component's injector.
  ```
  @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
  class MyDirective {
    constructor(someService: SomeService) {
    }
  }
  ```
  
  This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.
  
  
  ### Injecting a directive from the current element
  
  Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.
  
  ```
  @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
  class MyDirective {
    constructor(dependency: Dependency) {
      expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);
    }
  }
  ```
  This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case
  `dependency="3"`.
  
  ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements
  
  Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow
  DOM), i.e. on the current element, the
  parent element, or its parents.
  ```
  @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
  class MyDirective {
    constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {
      expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);
    }
  }
  ```
  
  `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If
  `dependency="2"` didn't
  exist on the direct parent, this injection would
  have returned
  `dependency="1"`.
  
  
  ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives
  
  
  A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated
  before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,
  the directive injects a <a href='../core/QueryList-class.html'><code>QueryList</code></a>, which updates its contents as children are added,
  removed, or moved by a directive that uses a <a href='../core/ViewContainerRef-class.html'><code>ViewContainerRef</code></a> such as a `ng-for`, an
  `ng-if`, or an `ng-switch`.
  
  ```
  @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
  class MyDirective {
    constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {
    }
  }
  ```
  
  This directive would be instantiated with a <a href='../core/QueryList-class.html'><code>QueryList</code></a> which contains `Dependency` 4 
  and 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.
  
  ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives
  
  By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child
  elements.
  
  ```
  @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
  class MyDirective {
    constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {
    }
  }
  ```
  
  This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.
  
  ### Optional injection
  
  The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be
  resolved. If you
  would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency
  with `@Optional()`.
  This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as
  optional.
  
  ```
  @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
  class MyDirective {
    constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {
    }
  }
  ```
  
  This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.
  If none can be
  found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.
  
  ## Example
  
  Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.
  
  ```
  @Directive({
    selector: '[tooltip]',
    properties: [
      'text: tooltip'
    ],
    hostListeners: {
      'onmouseenter': 'onMouseEnter()',
      'onmouseleave': 'onMouseLeave()'
    }
  })
  class Tooltip{
    text:string;
    overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
    overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
  
    constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {
      this.overlay = overlay;
    }
  
    onMouseEnter() {
      // exact signature to be determined
      this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);
    }
  
    onMouseLeave() {
      this.overlay.close();
      this.overlay = null;
    }
  }
  ```
  In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the
  `tooltip` selector,
  like so:
  
  ```
  <div tooltip="some text here"></div>
  ```
  
  Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template
  elements:
  
  A directive uses a <a href='../core/ViewContainerRef-class.html'><code>ViewContainerRef</code></a> to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at
  runtime.
  The <a href='../core/ViewContainerRef-class.html'><code>ViewContainerRef</code></a> is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a
  location in the current view
  where these actions are performed.
  
  Views are always created as children of the current <a href='View-var.html'><code>View</code></a>, and as siblings of the
  `<template>` element. Thus a
  directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.
  
  Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full
  `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular
  also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo="bar">` and `<li template="foo: bar">` are
  equivalent.
  
  Thus,
  
  ```
  <ul>
    <li *foo="bar" title="text"></li>
  </ul>
  ```
  
  Expands in use to:
  
  ```
  <ul>
    <template [foo]="bar">
      <li title="text"></li>
    </template>
  </ul>
  ```
  
  Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo="bar"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for
  the directive
  controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.
  
  
  ## Example
  
  Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.
  
  Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:
  
  ```
  @Directive({
    selector: '[unless]',
    properties: ['unless']
  })
  export class Unless {
    viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;
    templateRef: TemplateRef;
    prevCondition: boolean;
  
    constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {
      this.viewContainer = viewContainer;
      this.templateRef = templateRef;
      this.prevCondition = null;
    }
  
    set unless(newCondition) {
      if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {
        this.prevCondition = true;
        this.viewContainer.clear();
      } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {
        this.prevCondition = false;
        this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  
  We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:
  ```
  <ul>
    <li *unless="expr"></li>
  </ul>
  ```
  
  Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands
  and the result is:
  
  ```
  <ul>
    <template [unless]="exp">
      <li></li>
    </template>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
  ```
  
  Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,
  the instantiated
  view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.

  .l-sub-section
    h3 selector

    
    :markdown
      The CSS selector that triggers the instantiation of a directive.
      
      Angular only allows directives to trigger on CSS selectors that do not cross element
      boundaries.
      
      `selector` may be declared as one of the following:
      
      - `element-name`: select by element name.
      - `.class`: select by class name.
      - `[attribute]`: select by attribute name.
      - `[attribute=value]`: select by attribute name and value.
      - `:not(sub_selector)`: select only if the element does not match the `sub_selector`.
      - `selector1, selector2`: select if either `selector1` or `selector2` matches.
      
      
      
      
      Suppose we have a directive with an `input[type=text]` selector.
      
      And the following HTML:
      
      ```html
      <form>
        <input type="text">
        <input type="radio">
      <form>
      ```
      
      The directive would only be instantiated on the `<input type="text">` element.
      
      





  .l-sub-section
    h3 properties

    
    :markdown
      Enumerates the set of properties that accept data binding for a directive.
      
      The `properties` property defines a set of `directiveProperty` to `bindingProperty`
      configuration:
      
      - `directiveProperty` specifies the component property where the value is written.
      - `bindingProperty` specifies the DOM property where the value is read from.
      
      You can include a <a href='../change_detection/Pipe-interface.html'><code>Pipe</code></a> when specifying a `bindingProperty` to allow for data
      transformation and structural change detection of the value. These pipes will be evaluated in
      the context of this component.
      
      ## Syntax
      
      There is no need to specify both `directiveProperty` and `bindingProperty` when they both have
      the same value.
      
      ```
      @Directive({
        properties: [
          'propertyName', // shorthand notation for 'propertyName: propertyName'
          'directiveProperty1: bindingProperty1',
          'directiveProperty2: bindingProperty2 | pipe1 | ...',
          ...
        ]
      }
      ```
      
      
      ## Basic Property Binding
      
      We can easily build a simple `Tooltip` directive that exposes a `tooltip` property, which can
      be used in templates with standard Angular syntax. For example:
      
      ```
      @Directive({
        selector: '[tooltip]',
        properties: [
          'text: tooltip'
        ]
      })
      class Tooltip {
        set text(value: string) {
          // This will get called every time with the new value when the 'tooltip' property changes
        }
      }
      ```
      
      We can then bind to the `tooltip' property as either an expression (`someExpression`) or as a
      string literal, as shown in the HTML template below:
      
      ```html
      <div [tooltip]="someExpression">...</div>
      <div tooltip="Some Text">...</div>
      ```
      
      Whenever the `someExpression` expression changes, the `properties` declaration instructs
      Angular to update the `Tooltip`'s `text` property.
      
      ## Bindings With Pipes
      
      You can also use pipes when writing binding definitions for a directive.
      
      For example, we could write a binding that updates the directive on structural changes, rather
      than on reference changes, as normally occurs in change detection.
      
      See <a href='../change_detection/Pipe-interface.html'><code>Pipe</code></a> and `KeyValueChanges` documentation for more details.
      
      ```
      @Directive({
        selector: '[class-set]',
        properties: [
          'classChanges: classSet | keyValDiff'
        ]
      })
      class ClassSet {
        set classChanges(changes: KeyValueChanges) {
          // This will get called every time the `class-set` expressions changes its structure.
        }
      }
      ```
      
      The template that this directive is used in may also contain its own pipes. For example:
      
      ```html
      <div [class-set]="someExpression | somePipe">
      ```
      
      In this case, the two pipes compose as if they were inlined: `someExpression | somePipe |
      keyValDiff`.
      
      





  .l-sub-section
    h3 events

    
    :markdown
      Enumerates the set of emitted events.
      
      ## Syntax
      
      ```
      @Component({
        events: ['statusChange']
      })
      class TaskComponent {
        statusChange: EventEmitter;
      
        constructor() {
          this.statusChange = new EventEmitter();
        }
      
        onComplete() {
          this.statusChange.next('completed');
        }
      }
      ```
      
      Use `propertyName: eventName` when the event emitter property name is different from the name
      of the emitted event:
      
      ```
      @Component({
        events: ['status: statusChange']
      })
      class TaskComponent {
        status: EventEmitter;
      
        constructor() {
          this.status = new EventEmitter();
        }
      
        onComplete() {
          this.status.next('completed');
        }
      }
      ```
      
      





  .l-sub-section
    h3 host

    
    :markdown
      Specifiy the events, actions, properties and attributes related to the host element.
      
      ## Events
      
      Specifies which DOM hostListeners a directive listens to via a set of `(event)` to `method`
      key-value pairs:
      
      - `event1`: the DOM event that the directive listens to.
      - `statement`: the statement to execute when the event occurs.
      If the evalutation of the statement returns `false`, then `preventDefault`is applied on the DOM
      event.
      
      To listen to global events, a target must be added to the event name.
      The target can be `window`, `document` or `body`.
      
      When writing a directive event binding, you can also refer to the following local variables:
      - `$event`: Current event object which triggered the event.
      - `$target`: The source of the event. This will be either a DOM element or an Angular
      directive. (will be implemented in later release)
      
      ## Syntax
      
      ```
      @Directive({
        host: {
          '(event1)': 'onMethod1(arguments)',
          '(target:event2)': 'onMethod2(arguments)',
          ...
        }
      }
      ```
      
      ## Basic Event Binding:
      
      Suppose you want to write a directive that reacts to `change` events in the DOM and on
      `resize` events in window.
      You would define the event binding as follows:
      
      ```
      @Directive({
        selector: 'input',
        host: {
          '(change)': 'onChange($event)',
          '(window:resize)': 'onResize($event)'
        }
      })
      class InputDirective {
        onChange(event:Event) {
          // invoked when the input element fires the 'change' event
        }
        onResize(event:Event) {
          // invoked when the window fires the 'resize' event
        }
      }
      ```
      
      ## Properties
      
      Specifies which DOM properties a directives updates.
      
      ## Syntax
      
      ```
      @Directive({
        selector: 'input',
        host: {
          '[prop]': 'expression'
        }
      })
      class InputDirective {
        value:string;
      }
      ```
      
      In this example the prop property of the host element is updated with the expression value
      every time it changes.
      
      ## Attributes
      
      Specifies static attributes that should be propagated to a host element. Attributes specified
      in `hostAttributes` are propagated only if a given attribute is not present on a host element.
      
      ## Syntax
      
      ```
      @Directive({
        selector: '[my-button]',
        host: {
          'role': 'button'
        }
      })
      class MyButton {
      }
      ```
      
      In this example using `my-button` directive (ex.: `<div my-button></div>`) on a host element
      (here: `<div>` ) will ensure that this element will get the "button" role.
      
      ## Actions
      
      Specifies which DOM methods a directive can invoke.
      
      ## Syntax
      
      ```
      @Directive({
        selector: 'input',
        host: {
          '@emitFocus': 'focus()'
        }
      })
      class InputDirective {
        constructor() {
          this.emitFocus = new EventEmitter();
        }
      
        focus() {
          this.emitFocus.next();
        }
      }
      ```
      
      In this example calling focus on InputDirective will result in calling focus on the input.

      @Directive({
        selector: 'greet',
        bindings: [
          Greeter
        ]
      })
      class HelloWorld {
        greeter:Greeter;
      
        constructor(greeter:Greeter) {
          this.greeter = greeter;
        }
