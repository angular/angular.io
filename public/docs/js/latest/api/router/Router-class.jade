  # Router
  The router is responsible for mapping URLs to components.
  
  You can see the state of the router by inspecting the read-only field `router.navigating`.
  This may be useful for showing a spinner, for instance.
  
  ## Concepts
  Routers and component instances have a 1:1 correspondence.
  
  The router holds reference to a number of "outlets." An outlet is a placeholder that the
  router dynamically fills in depending on the current URL.
  
  When the router navigates from a URL, it must first recognizes it and serialize it into an
  `Instruction`.
  The router uses the `RouteRegistry` to get an `Instruction`.

      Constructs a child router. You probably don't need to use this unless you're writing a reusable
      component.

    :markdown

      Register an object to notify of route changes. You probably don't need to use this unless
      you're writing a reusable component.

    :markdown

      Dynamically update the routing configuration and trigger a navigation.
      
      # Usage
      
      ```
      router.config({ 'path': '/', 'component': IndexCmp});
      ```
      
      Or:
      
      ```
      router.config([
        { 'path': '/', 'component': IndexComp },
        { 'path': '/user/:id', 'component': UserComp },
      ]);
      ```

    h3 navigate

    
    pre.prettyprint
      code.
        navigate(url: string)
    
    :markdown

      Navigate to a URL. Returns a promise that resolves when navigation is complete.
      
      If the given URL begins with a `/`, router will navigate absolutely.
      If the given URL does not begin with `/`, the router will navigate relative to this component.
