  The `NgSwitch` directive is used to conditionally swap DOM structure on your template based on a
  scope expression.
  Elements within `NgSwitch` but without `NgSwitchWhen` or `NgSwitchDefault` directives will be
  preserved at the location as specified in the template.
  
  `NgSwitch` simply chooses nested elements and makes them visible based on which element matches
  the value obtained from the evaluated expression. In other words, you define a container element
  (where you place the directive), place an expression on the **`[ng-switch]="..."` attribute**),
  define any inner elements inside of the directive and place a `[ng-switch-when]` attribute per
  element.
  The when attribute is used to inform NgSwitch which element to display when the expression is
  evaluated. If a matching expression is not found via a when attribute then an element with the
  default attribute is displayed.
  
  # Example:
  
  ```
  <ANY [ng-switch]="expression">
    <template [ng-switch-when]="whenExpression1">...</template>
    <template [ng-switch-when]="whenExpression1">...</template>
    <template ng-switch-default>...</template>
  </ANY>
  ```
