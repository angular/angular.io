  The `NgNonBindable` directive tells Angular not to compile or bind the contents of the current
  DOM element. This is useful if the element contains what appears to be Angular directives and
  bindings but which should be ignored by Angular. This could be the case if you have a site that
  displays snippets of code, for instance.
  
  Example:
  
  ```
  <div>Normal: {{1 + 2}}</div> // output "Normal: 3"
  <div non-bindable>Ignored: {{1 + 2}}</div> // output "Ignored: {{1 + 2}}"
  ```
