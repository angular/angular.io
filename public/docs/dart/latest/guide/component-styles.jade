//- TODO: consider adding material equivalent to TS Appendices 1 & 2 if relevant.

block style-url-alert
  :marked
    The URL is ***relative to the Dart application package root*** which usually
    corresponds to project's `lib` folder.
    The style file URL is *not* relative to the component file.
  //- TODO: add back if ever we re-integrate appendix 2.
  //- See [Appendix 2](#relative-urls) to specify a URL relative to the component file.

  //- TODO: determine if an equivalent of the TS material is relevant for Dart.
  //- Leaving empty for now.

block css-import-url

    In *this* case the URL is relative to the CSS file into which we are importing.

      URLs are currently not interpreted in this way, see 
      [issue 8518](href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8518").
      Until this issue is fixed, absolute package-reference style URLs must 
      be given as is illustrated below.
    
block module-id
  p.
    Thankfully, this is the default interpretation of relative URLs in 
    Angular2 for Dart:
  +makeExample('component-styles/ts/app/quest-summary.component.ts', 'urls')(format='.')
  :marked
    Note that special measures must be taken in Angular2 for TypeScript, if
    relative URLs are to have the same interpretation. See 
    [here](../../../ts/latest/guide/component-styles.html#!#relative-urls)
    for details.
