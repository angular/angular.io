    Note that the URLs in `styleUrls` are relative to the component.

  //- TODO: determine if an equivalent of the TS material is relevant for Dart.

      URLs are currently not interpreted in this way, see 
      [issue 8518](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8518).

      be given as is illustrated below.

  :marked

    Angular2 for Dart:

  +makeExcerpt('app/quest-summary.component.ts', 'urls', '')
