  # Providing HTTP services

  First, configure the application to use server communication facilities.

  The !{_Angular_Http} client communicates with the server using a familiar HTTP request/response protocol.
  The `!{_Http}` client is one of a family of services in the !{_Angular_http_library}.

+ifDocsFor('ts')
  .l-sub-section
    :marked
      When importing from the `@angular/http` module, SystemJS knows how to load services from
      the !{_Angular_http_library}
      because the `systemjs.config.js` file maps to that module name.

:marked
  Before you can use the `!{_Http}` client, you need to register it as a service provider with the dependency injection system.

.l-sub-section

    Read about providers in the [Dependency Injection](dependency-injection.html) page.

    Begin by importing the necessary members.
    The newcomers are the `HttpModule` and the `JsonpModule` from the !{_Angular_http_library}. For more information about imports and related terminology, see the [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) on the `import` statement.

    To add these modules to the application, pass them to the `imports` array in the root `@NgModule`.

    The `HttpModule` is necessary for making HTTP calls.

  ## The Tour of Heroes HTTP client demo

  The first demo is a mini-version of the [tutorial](../tutorial)'s "Tour of Heroes" (ToH) application.
  This version gets some heroes from the server, displays them in a list, lets the user add new heroes, and saves them to the server.
  The app uses the !{_Angular_Http} client to communicate via `XMLHttpRequest (XHR)`.

  It works like this:
figure.image-display
  img(src='/resources/images/devguide/server-communication/http-toh.gif' alt="ToH mini app" width="250")
:marked
  This demo has a single component, the `HeroListComponent`.  Here's its template:
+makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero-list.component.html', null, 'app/toh/hero-list.component.html (template)')
:marked
  It presents the list of heroes with an `ngFor`.
  Below the list is an input box and an *Add Hero* button where you can enter the names of new heroes
  and add them to the database.
  A [template reference variable](template-syntax.html#ref-vars), `newHeroName`, accesses the
  value of the input box in the `(click)` event binding.
  When the user clicks the button, that value passes to the component's `addHero` method and then
  the event binding clears it to make it ready for a new hero name.

  Below the button is an area for an error message.

  ### The *HeroListComponent* class
  Here's the component class:
+makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero-list.component.ts','component', 'app/toh/hero-list.component.ts (class)')
:marked
  Angular [injects](dependency-injection.html) a `HeroService` into the constructor
  and the component calls that service to fetch and save data.

  The component **does not talk directly to the !{_Angular_Http} client**.
  The component doesn't know or care how it gets the data.
  It delegates to the `HeroService`.

  This is a golden rule: **always delegate data access to a supporting service class**.

  Although _at runtime_ the component requests heroes immediately after creation,
  you **don't** call the service's `get` method in the component's constructor.
  Instead, call it inside the `ngOnInit` [lifecycle hook](lifecycle-hooks.html)
  and rely on Angular to call `ngOnInit` when it instantiates this component.
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    This is a *best practice*.
    Components are easier to test and debug when their constructors are simple, and all real work
    (especially calling a remote server) is handled in a separate method.
block getheroes-and-addhero
  :marked
    The service's `getHeroes()` and `addHero()` methods return an `Observable` of hero data that the !{_Angular_Http} client fetched from the server.

    Think of an `Observable` as a stream of events published by some source.
    To listen for events in this stream, ***subscribe*** to the `Observable`.
    These subscriptions specify the actions to take when the web request
    produces a success event (with the hero data in the event payload) or a fail event (with the error in the payload).

:marked
  With a basic understanding of the component, you're ready to look inside the `HeroService`.

a#HeroService
.l-main-section#fetch-data
:marked
  ## Fetch data with http.get

  In many of the previous samples the app faked the interaction with the server by
  returning mock heroes in a service like this one:
+makeExample('toh-4/ts/app/hero.service.ts', 'just-get-heroes')(format=".")
:marked
  You can revise that `HeroService` to get the heroes from the server using the !{_Angular_Http} client service:
+makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero.service.ts', 'v1', 'app/toh/hero.service.ts (revised)')

:marked
  Notice that the !{_Angular_Http} client service is
  [injected](dependency-injection.html) into the `HeroService` constructor.
+makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero.service.ts', 'ctor')
:marked
  Look closely at how to call `!{_priv}http.get`:
+makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero.service.ts', 'http-get', 'app/toh/hero.service.ts (getHeroes)')(format=".")
:marked
  You pass the resource URL to `get` and it calls the server which returns heroes.

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    The server returns heroes once you've set up the [in-memory web api](#in-mem-web-api)
    described in the appendix below.
    Alternatively, you can temporarily target a JSON file by changing the endpoint URL:
  +makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero.service.ts', 'endpoint-json')(format=".")

+ifDocsFor('ts')
  :marked
    <a id="rxjs"></a>
    If you are familiar with asynchronous methods in modern JavaScript, you might expect the `get` method to return a
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise" target="_blank" title="Promise">promise</a>.
    You'd expect to chain a call to `then()` and extract the heroes.
    Instead you're calling a `map()` method.
    Clearly this is not a promise.

    In fact, the `http.get` method returns an **Observable** of HTTP Responses (`Observable<Response>`) from the RxJS library
    and `map` is one of the RxJS *operators*.

  .l-main-section
  :marked
    ## RxJS library
    <a href="http://reactivex.io/rxjs" target="_blank" title="RxJS Reactive Extensions">RxJS</a>
    is a third party library, endorsed by Angular, that implements the 
    <a href="" target="_blank" title="Video: Rob Wormald on observables"><b>asynchronous observable</b></a> pattern.

    All of the Developer Guide samples have installed the RxJS npm package
    because observables are used widely in Angular applications.
    _This_ app needs it when working with the HTTP client.
    But you must take a critical extra step to make RxJS observables usable: 
    you must import the RxJS operators individually.

    ### Enable RxJS operators
    The RxJS library is large.
    Size matters when building a production application and deploying it to mobile devices.
    You should include only necessary features.

    Each code file should add the operators it needs by importing from an RxJS library.
    The `getHeroes` method needs the `map` and `catch` operators so it imports them like this.
  +makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero.service.ts', 'rxjs-imports', 'app/app.component.ts (import rxjs)')(format=".")

.l-main-section
a#extract-data
:marked
  ## Process the response object
  Remember that the `getHeroes()` method used an `!{_priv}extractData` helper method to map the `!{_priv}http.get` response object to heroes:
+makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero.service.ts', 'extract-data', 'app/toh/hero.service.ts (excerpt)')(format=".")
:marked
  The `response` object doesn't hold the data in a form the app can use directly.
  You must parse the response data into a JSON object.

  ### Parse to JSON
block parse-json
  :marked
    The response data are in JSON string form.
    The app must parse that string into JavaScript objects by calling `response.json()`.


  .l-sub-section
    :marked
      This is not Angular's own design.
      The Angular HTTP client follows the Fetch specification for the
      [response object](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response-class) returned by the `Fetch` function.
      That spec defines a `json()` method that parses the response body into a JavaScript object.

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Don't expect the decoded JSON to be the heroes !{_array} directly.
    This server always wraps JSON results in an object with a `data`
    property. You have to unwrap it to get the heroes.
    This is conventional web API behavior, driven by
    [security concerns](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AJAX_Security_Guidelines#Always_return_JSON_with_an_Object_on_the_outside).

.alert.is-important
  :marked
     Make no assumptions about the server API.
     Not all servers return an object with a `data` property.
:marked
  ### Do not return the response object
  The `getHeroes()` method _could_ have returned the HTTP response but this wouldn't
  be a best practice.
  The point of a data service is to hide the server interaction details from consumers.
  The component that calls the `HeroService` only wants heroes and is kept separate
  from getting them, the code dealing with where they come from, and the response object.

+ifDocsFor('ts')
  .callout.is-important
    header HTTP GET is delayed
    :marked
      The `!{_priv}http.get` does **not send the request just yet.** This observable is
      [*cold*](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/gettingstarted/creating.md#cold-vs-hot-observables),
      which means that the request won't go out until something *subscribes* to the observable.
      That *something* is the [HeroListComponent](#subscribe).

a#error-handling
:marked
  ### Always handle errors

  An important part of dealing with I/O is anticipating errors by preparing to catch them
  and do something with them. One way to handle errors is to pass an error message
  back to the component for presentation to the user,
  but only if it says something that the user can understand and act upon.
  
  This simple app conveys that idea, albeit imperfectly, in the way it handles a `getHeroes` error.

+makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero.service.ts', 'error-handling', 'app/toh/hero.service.ts (excerpt)')(format=".")

block error-handling
  :marked
    The `catch` operator passes the error object from `http` to the `handleError` method.
    The `handleError` method transforms the error into a developer-friendly message, 
    logs it to the console, and returns the message in a new, failed observable via `Observable.throw`.

a#subscribe

h3 #[b HeroListComponent] error handling
block hlc-error-handling

    Back in the `HeroListComponent`, in `!{_priv}heroService.getHeroes()`,
    the `subscribe` function has a second function parameter to handle the error message.
    It sets an `errorMessage` variable that's bound conditionally in the `HeroListComponent` template.

  ## Send data to the server

  So far you've seen how to retrieve data from a remote location using an HTTP service.
  Now you'll add the ability to create new heroes and save them in the backend.

  You'll write a method for the `HeroListComponent` to call, an `addHero()` method, that takes
  just the name of a new hero and returns an `Observable` of `Hero`. It begins like this:

+makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero.service.ts', 'addhero-sig')(format=".")

:marked
  To implement it, you must know the server's API for creating heroes.

  [This sample's data server](#server) follows typical REST guidelines.
  It expects a [`POST`](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.5) request
  at the same endpoint as `GET` heroes.
  It expects the new hero data to arrive in the body of the request,
  structured like a `Hero` entity but without the `id` property.
  The body of the request should look like this:

code-example(format="." language="javascript").
  { "name": "Windstorm" }
:marked
  The server generates the `id` and returns the entire `JSON` representation
  of the new hero including its generated id. The hero arrives tucked inside a response object
  with its own `data` property.

  Now that you know how the API works, implement `addHero()`as follows:

+ifDocsFor('ts')
  +makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero.service.ts', 'import-request-options', 'app/toh/hero.service.ts (additional imports)')(format=".")
+makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero.service.ts', 'addhero', 'app/toh/hero.service.ts (addHero)')(format=".")

:marked
  ### Headers

  In the `headers` object, the `Content-Type` specifies that the body represents JSON.

+ifDocsFor('ts')
  :marked
    Next, the `headers` object is used to configure the `options` object. The `options`
    object is a new instance of `RequestOptions`, a class that allows you to specify
    certain settings when instantiating a request. In this way, [headers](../api/http/index/Headers-class.html) is one of the [RequestOptions](../api/http/index/RequestOptions-class.html).

    In the `return` statement, `options` is the *third* argument of the `post` method, as shown above.

:marked
  ### JSON results

  As with `getHeroes()`, use the `!{_priv}extractData()` helper to [extract the data](#extract-data)
  from the response.

block hero-list-comp-add-hero
  :marked
    Back in the `HeroListComponent`, *its* `addHero()` method subscribes to the observable returned by the *service's* `addHero()` method.
    When the data arrive it pushes the new hero object into its `heroes` array for presentation to the user.
+makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero-list.component.ts', 'addHero', 'app/toh/hero-list.component.ts (addHero)')(format=".")

+ifDocsFor('ts')
  h2#promises Fall back to promises
  :marked
    Although the Angular `http` client API returns an `Observable<Response>` you can turn it into a
    [`Promise<Response>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).
    It's easy to do, and in simple cases, a promise-based version looks much
    like the observable-based version.
  .l-sub-section
    :marked
      While promises may be more familiar, observables have many advantages.

  :marked
    Here is a comparison of the `HeroService` using promises versus observables,
    highlighting just the parts that are different.
  +makeTabs(
    'server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero.service.promise.ts,server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero.service.ts',
    'methods, methods',
    'app/toh/hero.service.promise.ts (promise-based), app/toh/hero.service.ts (observable-based)')
  :marked
    You can follow the promise `then(this.extractData).catch(this.handleError)` pattern as in
    this example.

    Alternatively, you can call `toPromise(success, fail)`. The observable's `map` callback moves to the first *success* parameter and its `catch` callback to the second *fail* parameter in this pattern: `.toPromise(this.extractData, this.handleError)`.

    The `errorHandler` forwards an error message as a failed promise instead of a failed `observable`.

    The diagnostic *log to console* is just one more `then` in the promise chain.

    You have to adjust the calling component to expect a `Promise` instead of an `observable`:

  +makeTabs(
    'server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero-list.component.promise.ts, server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero-list.component.ts',
    'methods, methods',
    'app/toh/hero-list.component.promise.ts (promise-based), app/toh/hero-list.component.ts (observable-based)')
  :marked
    The only obvious difference is that you call `then` on the returned promise instead of `subscribe`.
    Both methods take the same functional arguments.
  .l-sub-section
    :marked
      The less obvious but critical difference is that these two methods return very different results.

      The promise-based `then` returns another promise. You can keep chaining more `then` and `catch` calls, getting a new promise each time.

      The `subscribe` method returns a `Subscription`. A `Subscription` is not another `Observable`.
      It's the end of the line for observables. You can't call `map` on it or call `subscribe` again.
      The `Subscription` object has a different purpose, signified by its primary method, `unsubscribe`.

      To understand the implications and consequences of subscriptions, watch [Ben Lesh's talk on observables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LKMwkuK0ZE) or his video course on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lessons/rxjs-rxjs-observables-vs-promises).

h2#cors Cross-Origin Requests: Wikipedia example
:marked
  You just learned how to make `XMLHttpRequests` using the !{_Angular_Http} service.
  This is the most common approach for server communication, but it doesn't work in all scenarios.

  For security reasons, web browsers block `XHR` calls to a remote server whose origin is different from the origin of the web page.
  The *origin* is the combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number.
  This is called the [same-origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy).

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Modern browsers do allow `XHR` requests to servers from a different origin if the server supports the
    [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) protocol.
    If the server requires user credentials, you'll enable them in the [request headers](#headers).

:marked
  Some servers do not support CORS but do support an older, read-only alternative called [JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP).
  Wikipedia is one such server.

  ### Search wikipedia

  Here is a simple search that shows suggestions from Wikipedia as the user
  types in a text box:

figure.image-display
  img(src='/resources/images/devguide/server-communication/wiki-1.gif' alt="Wikipedia search app (v.1)" width="250")

block wikipedia-jsonp+
  :marked
    Wikipedia offers a modern `CORS` API and a legacy `JSONP` search API. This example uses the latter.
    The Angular `Jsonp` service both extends the `!{_Http}` service for JSONP and restricts you to `GET` requests.
    All other HTTP methods throw an error because JSONP is a read-only facility.

    As always, wrap the interaction with an Angular data access client service inside a dedicated service, here called `WikipediaService`.

  +makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/wiki/wikipedia.service.ts',null,'app/wiki/wikipedia.service.ts')
  :marked
    The constructor expects Angular to inject its `jsonp` service, which 
    is available because `JsonpModule` is in the root `@NgModule` `imports` array
    in `app.module.ts`.

  <a id="query-parameters"></a>
  :marked
    ### Search parameters
    The [Wikipedia "opensearch" API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Opensearch)
    expects four parameters (key/value pairs) to arrive in the request URL's query string.
    The keys are `search`, `action`, `format`, and `callback`.
    The value of the `search` key is the user-supplied search term to find in Wikipedia.
    The other three are the fixed values "opensearch", "json", and "JSONP_CALLBACK" respectively.
  .l-sub-section
    :marked
      The `JSONP` technique requires that you pass a callback function name to the server in the query string: `callback=JSONP_CALLBACK`.
      The server uses that name to build a JavaScript wrapper function in its response, which Angular ultimately calls to extract the data.
      All of this happens under the hood.
  :marked
    If you're looking for articles with the word "Angular", you could construct the query string by hand and call `jsonp` like this:
  +makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/wiki/wikipedia.service.1.ts','query-string')(format='.')
  :marked
    In more parameterized examples you could build the query string with the Angular `URLSearchParams` helper:
  +makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/wiki/wikipedia.service.ts','search-parameters','app/wiki/wikipedia.service.ts (search parameters)')(format=".")
  :marked
    This time you call `jsonp` with *two* arguments: the `wikiUrl` and an options object whose `search` property is the `params` object.
  +makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/wiki/wikipedia.service.ts','call-jsonp','app/wiki/wikipedia.service.ts (call jsonp)')(format=".")
  :marked
    `Jsonp` flattens the `params` object into the same query string you saw earlier, putting the request on the wire.

  <a id="wikicomponent"></a>
  :marked
    ### The WikiComponent

    Now that you have a service that can query the Wikipedia API,
    turn your attention to the component (template and class) that takes user input and displays search results.
  +makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/wiki/wiki.component.ts', null, 'app/wiki/wiki.component.ts')
  :marked
    The template presents an `<input>` element *search box* to gather search terms from the user,
    and calls a `search(term)` method after each `keyup` event.

    The component's `search(term)` method delegates to the `WikipediaService`, which returns an 
    observable array of string results (`Observable<string[]>`).
    Instead of subscribing to the observable inside the component, as in the `HeroListComponent`,
    the app forwards the observable result to the template (via `items`) where the `async` pipe 
    in the `ngFor` handles the subscription. Read more about [async pipes](pipes.html#async-pipe)
    in the [Pipes](pipes.html) page.
  .l-sub-section
    :marked
      The [async pipe](pipes.html#async-pipe) is a good choice in read-only components where the component has no need to interact with the data.

      `HeroListComponent` can't use the pipe because `addHero()` pushes newly created heroes into the list.

  :marked
    ## A wasteful app

    The wikipedia search makes too many calls to the server.
    It is inefficient, and potentially expensive on mobile devices with limited data plans.

    ### 1. Wait for the user to stop typing
    Presently, the code calls the server after every keystroke.
    It should only make requests when the user *stops typing* .
    Here's how it will work after refactoring:
  figure.image-display
    img(src='/resources/images/devguide/server-communication/wiki-2.gif' alt="Wikipedia search app (v.2)" width="250")
  :marked
    ### 2. Search when the search term changes

    Suppose a user enters the word *angular* in the search box and pauses for a while.
    The application issues a search request for *angular*.

    Then the user backspaces over the last three letters, *lar*, and immediately re-types *lar* before pausing once more.
    The search term is still _angular_. The app shouldn't make another request.

    ### 3. Cope with out-of-order responses

    The user enters *angular*, pauses, clears the search box, and enters *http*.
    The application issues two search requests, one for *angular* and one for *http*.

    Which response arrives first? It's unpredictable.
    When there are multiple requests in-flight, the app should present the responses
    in the original request order. 
    In this example, the app must always display the results for the *http* search
    no matter which response arrives first.

    ## More fun with observables

    You could make changes to the `WikipediaService`, but for a better
    user experience, create a copy of the `WikiComponent` instead and make it smarter,

    `server-communication/ts/app/wiki/wiki-smart.component.ts,
    server-communication/ts/app/wiki/wiki.component.ts`,

    While the templates are virtually identical,
    there's a lot more RxJS in the "smart" version, 
    starting with `debounceTime`, `distinctUntilChanged`, and `switchMap` operators,
    imported as [described above](#rxjs).

    ### Create a stream of search terms

    The `WikiComponent` passes a new search term directly to the `WikipediaService` after every keystroke.

    The `WikiSmartComponent` class turns the user's keystrokes into an observable _stream of search terms_
    with the help of a `Subject`, which you import from RxJS:
  +makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/wiki/wiki-smart.component.ts', 'import-subject')(format='.')
  :marked
    The component creates a `searchTermStream` as a `Subject` of type `string`.
    The `search` method adds each new search box value to that stream via the subject's `next` method.

  +makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/wiki/wiki-smart.component.ts', 'subject')(format='.')

  :marked
    ### Listen for search terms
   
    The `WikiSmartComponent` listens to the *stream of search terms* and 
    processes that stream _before_ calling the service.
  +makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/wiki/wiki-smart.component.ts', 'observable-operators')(format='.')
  :marked
    * <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/debounce.md" target="_blank" title="debounce operator"><i>debounceTime</i></a>
    waits for the user to stop typing for at least 300 milliseconds.

    * <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/distinctuntilchanged.md" target="_blank" title="distinctUntilChanged operator"><i>distinctUntilChanged</i></a>
    ensures that the service is called only when the new search term is different from the previous search term.

    * The <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/flatmaplatest.md" target="_blank" title="switchMap operator"><i>switchMap</i></a>
    calls the `WikipediaService` with a fresh, debounced search term and coordinates the stream(s) of service response.

    The role of `switchMap` is particularly important.
    The `WikipediaService` returns a separate observable of string arrays (`Observable<string[]>`) for each search request.
    The user could issue multiple requests before a slow server has had time to reply,
    which means a backlog of response observables could arrive at the client, at any moment, in any order.

    The `switchMap` returns its own observable that _combines_ all `WikipediaService` response observables,
    re-arranges them in their original request order,
    and delivers to subscribers only the most recent search results.

  ## Guarding against Cross-Site Request Forgery

  In a cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF), an attacker tricks the user into visiting
  a different web page with malignant code that secretly sends a malicious request to your application's web server,
  
  The server and client application must work together to thwart this attack.
  Angular's `Http` client does its part by applying a default `CookieXSRFStrategy` automatically to all requests.

  The `CookieXSRFStrategy` supports a common anti-XSRF technique in which the server sends a randomly
  generated authentication token in a cookie named `XSRF-TOKEN`. 
  The HTTP client adds an `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header with that token value to subsequent requests. 
  The server receives both the cookie and the header, compares them, and processes the request only if the cookie and header match.
  
  See the [XSRF topic on the Security page](security.html#xsrf) for more information about XSRF and Angular's `XSRFStrategy` counter measures.

  ## Override default request headers (and other request options)

  Request options (such as headers) are merged into the
  [default _RequestOptions_](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/http/index/BaseRequestOptions-class.html "API: BaseRequestOptions") 
  before the request is processed.
  The `HttpModule` provides these default options via the `RequestOptions` token.

  You can override these defaults to suit your application needs.
  by creating a custom sub-class of `RequestOptions`
  that sets the default options for the application.

  This sample creates a class that sets the default `Content-Type` header to JSON.
  It exports a constant with the necessary `RequestOptions` provider to simplify registration in `AppModule`.

+makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/default-request-options.service.ts', '', 'app/default-request-options.service.ts')(format=".")
:marked
  Then it registers the provider in the root `AppModule`.
+makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/app.module.ts', 'provide-default-request-options', 'app/app.module.ts (provide default request header)')(format=".")
.l-sub-section
 :marked
   Remember to include this provider during setup when unit testing the app's HTTP services.
:marked
  After this change, the `header` option setting in `HeroService.addHero` is no longer necessary,

+makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero.service.ts', 'addhero', 'app/toh/hero.service.ts (addHero)')(format=".")
:marked
  You can confirm that `DefaultRequestOptions` is working by examing HTTP requests in the browser developer tools' network tab.
  If you're short-circuiting the server call with something like the [_in-memory web api_](#in-mem-web-api),
  try commenting-out the `addHero` header option, 
  set a breakpoint on the POST call, and step through the request processing
  to verify the header is there.
  
  Individual requests options, like this one, take precedence over the default `RequestOptions`.
  It might be wise to keep the `addHero` request header setting for extra safety.

  ## Appendix: Tour of Heroes _in-memory web api_

  If the app only needed to retrieve data, you could get the heroes from a `heroes.json` file:
- var _heroesJsonPath = (_docsFor == 'dart' ? 'web' : 'app') + '/heroes.json';
+makeJson('server-communication/' + _docsFor + '/' + _heroesJsonPath, null, _heroesJsonPath)(format=".")
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    You wrap the heroes array in an object with a `data` property for the same reason that a data server does:
    to mitigate the [security risk](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3503102/what-are-top-level-json-arrays-and-why-are-they-a-security-risk)
    posed by top-level JSON arrays.
:marked
  You'd set the endpoint to the JSON file like this:
+makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero.service.ts', 'endpoint-json', 'app/toh/hero.service.ts')(format=".")

- var _a_ca_class_with = _docsFor === 'ts' ? 'a custom application class with' : ''
:marked
  The *get heroes* scenario would work,
  but since the app can't save changes to a JSON file, it needs a web API server.
  Because there isn't a real server for this demo, 
  it substitutes the Angular _in-memory web api_ simulator for the actual XHR backend service.

.l-sub-section

    The in-memory web api is not part of Angular _proper_. 
    It's an optional service in its own 
    <a href="https://github.com/angular/in-memory-web-api" target="_blank" title="In-memory Web API"><i>angular-in-memory-web-api</i></a>
    library installed with npm (see `package.json`).

    See the
    <a href="https://github.com/angular/in-memory-web-api/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" title='In-memory Web API "README.md"'><i>README file</i></a>
    for configuration options, default behaviors, and limitations.

:marked
  The in-memory web API gets its data from !{_a_ca_class_with} a `createDb()`
  method that returns a map whose keys are collection names and whose values
  are !{_array}s of objects in those collections.

  Here's the class for this sample, based on the JSON data:
+makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/hero-data.ts', null, 'app/hero-data.ts')(format=".")
:marked
  Ensure that the `HeroService` endpoint refers to the web API:
+makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/toh/hero.service.ts', 'endpoint', 'app/toh/hero.service.ts')(format=".")

  :marked
    Finally, redirect client HTTP requests to the in-memory web API by
    adding the `InMemoryWebApiModule` to the `AppModule.imports` list.
    At the same time, call its `forRoot` configuration method with the `HeroData` class.
  +makeExample('server-communication/ts/app/app.module.ts', 'in-mem-web-api', 'app/app.module.ts')(format=".")
  :marked
    ### How it works

    Angular's `http` service delegates the client/server communication tasks
    to a helper service called the `XHRBackend`.

    Using standard Angular provider registration techniques, the `InMemoryWebApiModule`
    replaces the default `XHRBackend` service with its own in-memory alternative.
    At the same time, the `forRoot` method initializes the in-memory web API with the *seed data* from the mock hero dataset.
  .l-sub-section
    :marked
      The `forRoot` method name is a strong reminder that you should only call the `InMemoryWebApiModule` _once_,
      while setting the metadata for the root `AppModule`. Don't call it again.
:marked
  Here is the final, revised version of <span ngio-ex>app/app.module.ts</span>, demonstrating these steps.

+makeExcerpt('app/app.module.ts')
.alert.is-important
  :marked
    Import the `InMemoryWebApiModule` _after_ the `HttpModule` to ensure that 
    the `XHRBackend` provider of the `InMemoryWebApiModule` supersedes all others.
