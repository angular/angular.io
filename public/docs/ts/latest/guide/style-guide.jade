  Welcome to the Angular 2 Guide of Style (version 5)

  ## Purpose

  If you are looking for an opinionated style guide for syntax, conventions, and structuring Angular applications, then step right in.

  The purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance on building Angular applications by showing the conventions we use and, more importantly, why we choose them.

  ## Style Vocabulary

  Each guideline describes either a good or bad practice, and all have a consistent presentation.
  
  The wording of each guideline indicates how strong the recommendation is.
  
.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** is one that should always be followed. 
    _Always_ might be a bit too strong a word.
    Guidelines that literally should always be followed are extremely rare. 
    On the other hand, we need a really unusual case for breaking a *Do* guideline.
  
.s-rule.consider
  :marked
    **Consider** guidelines should generally be followed.    
    If you fully understand the meaning behind the guideline and have a good reason to deviate, then do so. Please strive to be consistent.
    
.s-rule.avoid
  :marked
    **Avoid** indicates something we should almost never do. Code examples to *avoid* have an unmistakeable red header.
.l-main-section
    
:marked
  ## File Structure Conventions

  Some code examples display a file that has one or more similarly named companion files. (e.g. hero.component.ts and hero.component.html). 
  
  The guideline will use the shortcut `hero.component.ts|html|css|spec` to represent that various files. This makes this guide's file structures easier to read and more terse.

  ## Single Responsibility

  We apply the [Single Responsibility Principle](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) to all Components, Services, and other symbols we create. This helps make our app cleaner, easier to read and maintain, and more testable.  

  ### Rule of One
  <a id="01-01"></a>
  #### Style 01-01
.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** define one thing (e.g. service or component) per file.

.s-rule.consider
  :marked
    **Consider** limiting files to 400 lines of code.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** One component per file makes it far easier to read, maintain, and avoid collisions with teams in source control.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** One component per file avoids hidden bugs that often arise when combining components in a file where they may share variables, create unwanted closures, or unwanted coupling with dependencies.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** A single component can be the default export for its file which facilitates lazy loading with the Component Router.
:marked
  The key is to make the code more reusable, easier to read, and less mistake prone.
    
  The following *negative* example defines the `AppComponent`, bootstraps the app, defines the `Hero` model object, and loads heroes from the server ... all in the same file. *Don't do this*.

+makeExample('style-guide/ts/01-01/app/heroes/hero.component.avoid.ts', '', 'app/heroes/hero.component.ts')(avoid=1)
:marked
  Better to redistribute the component and supporting activities into their own dedicated files.

+makeTabs(
  `style-guide/ts/01-01/app/main.ts,
  style-guide/ts/01-01/app/app.component.ts,
  style-guide/ts/01-01/app/heroes/heroes.component.ts,
  style-guide/ts/01-01/app/heroes/shared/hero.service.ts,
  style-guide/ts/01-01/app/heroes/shared/hero.model.ts,  
  style-guide/ts/01-01/app/heroes/shared/mock-heroes.ts`,
  '',
  `app/main.ts, 
  app/app.component.ts, 
  app/heroes/heroes.component.ts, 
  app/heroes/shared/hero.service.ts, 
  app/heroes/shared/hero.model.ts,
  app/heroes/shared/mock-heroes.ts`)

:marked
  As the app grows, this rule becomes even more important.

  ### Small Functions
  <a id="01-02"></a>
  #### Style 01-02
.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** define small functions
    
.s-rule.consider
  :marked
    **Consider** limiting to no more than 75 lines.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Small functions are easier to test, especially when they do one thing and serve one purpose.

    **Why?** Small functions promote reuse.

    **Why?** Small functions are easier to read.

    **Why?** Small functions are easier to maintain.

    **Why?** Small functions help avoid hidden bugs that come with large functions that share variables with external scope, create unwanted closures, or unwanted coupling with dependencies.

  ## Naming

  Naming conventions are hugely important to maintainbility and readability. This guide will recommend naming conventions for the file name and the symbol name.


.l-main-section
:marked
  ### General Naming Guidelines
  <a id="02-01"></a>
  #### Style 02-01

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use consistent names for all symbols.
    
.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** follow a pattern that describes the symbol's feature then its type. The recommended pattern is `feature.type.ts`.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Naming conventions help provide a consistent way to find content at a glance. Consistency within the project is vital. Consistency with a team is important. Consistency across a company provides tremendous efficiency.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** The naming conventions should simply help we find our code faster and make it easier to understand.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Names of folders and files should clearly convey their intent. For example, `app/heroes/hero-list.component.ts` may contain a component that manages a list of heroes.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Separate File Names with Dots and Dashes
  <a id="02-02"></a>
  #### Style 02-02

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use dashes to separate words. 

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use dots to separate the descriptive name from the type.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use consistent names for all components following a pattern that describes the component's feature then its type. A recommended pattern is `feature.type.ts`.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use conventional suffixes for the types including `*.service.ts`, `*.component.ts`, `*.pipe.ts`. Invent other suffixes where desired for our team, but take care in having too many.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Provides a consistent way to quickly identify what is in the file.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Provides a consistent way to quickly find a specific file using an editor or IDE's fuzzy search techniques.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Provides pattern matching for any automated tasks.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Components and Directives
  <a id="02-03"></a>
  #### Style 02-03

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use consistent names for all assets named after what they represent.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use UpperCamelCase for symbols. Match the name of the symbol to the naming of the file.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** append the symbol name with the suffix that it represents.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Provides a consistent way to quickly identify and reference assets.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** UpperCamelCase is conventional for identifying object that can be instantiated using a constructor.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** The `Component` suffix is more commonly used and is more explicitly descriptive.

:marked
  ```
  /* recommended */
  AppComponent         // app.component.ts
  HeroesComponent      // heroes.component.ts
  HeroListComponent    // hero-list.component.ts
  HeroDetailComponent  // hero-detail.component.ts

  /* recommended */
  ValidationDirective  // validation.directive.ts
  ```

  ### Service Names
  <a id="02-04"></a>
  #### Style 02-04

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use consistent names for all services named after their feature. 
    
.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use UpperCamelCase for services. 
    
.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** suffix services with `Service` when it is not clear what they are (e.g. when they are nouns).

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Provides a consistent way to quickly identify and reference services.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Clear service names such as `logger` do not require a suffix.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Service names such as `Credit` are nouns and require a suffix and should be named with a suffix when it is not obvious if it is a service or something else.

:marked
  ```
  HeroDataService    // hero-data.service.ts
  CreditService      // credit.service.ts
  LoggerService      // logger.service.ts
  ```

  ### Bootstrapping
  <a id="02-05"></a>
  #### Style 02-05

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** put bootstrapping and platform logic for the app in a file named `main.ts`.

.s-rule.avoid
  :marked
    **Avoid** putting app logic in the `main.ts`. Instead consider placing it in a Component or Service.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Follows a consistent convention for the startup logic of an app.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Follows a familar convention from other technology platforms.

  ### Use lowerCamelCase for Directive Selectors
  <a id="02-06"></a>
  #### Style 02-06

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** Use lowerCamelCase for naming the selectors of our directives.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Keeps the names of the properties defined in the directives that are bound to the view consistent with the attribute names.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** The Angular 2 HTML parser is case sensitive and will recognize lowerCamelCase

.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Custom Prefix for Components
  <a id="02-07"></a>
  #### Style 02-07

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use a custom prefix for the selector of our components. For example, the prefix `toh` represents from **T**our **o**f **H**eroes and the prefix `admin` represents an admin feature area.
    
.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use a prefix that identifies the feature area or the app itself.  
    
.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Prevents name collisions

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Our Components and elements are easily identified
    
.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Makes it easier to promoted and share our feature in other apps.

  ### Custom Prefix for Directives
  <a id="02-08"></a>
  #### Style 02-08

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use a custom prefix for the selector of our directives (for instance below is used the prefix `toh` from **T**our **o**f **H**eroes).

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Prevents name collisions

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Our Directives are easily identified

  ### Unit Test File Names
  <a id="02-10"></a>
  #### Style 02-10

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** name test specification files the same as the component they test
    
.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** name test specification files with a suffix of `.spec`.

.s-why
  :marked
      **Why?** Provides a consistent way to quickly identify tests.

.s-why
  :marked
      **Why?** Provides pattern matching for [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) or other test runners.

:marked
  ```
  // recommended

  // Components
  heroes.component.spec.ts
  hero-list.component.spec.ts
  hero-detail.component.spec.ts

  ### End to End Test File Names
  <a id="02-11"></a>
  #### Style 02-11

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** name end-to-end test specification files after the feature they test with a suffix of `.e2e-spec`.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Provides a consistent way to quickly identify end-to-end tests.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Provides pattern matching for test runners and build automation.

  ## TypeScript Conventions

  Have consistent set of coding, naming, and whitespace conventions.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Classes
  <a id="03-01"></a>
  #### Style 03-01

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use upper camel case when naming classes. 
    
.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Follows conventional thinking for class names.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Classes can be instantiated and construct an instance. We often use UpperCamelCase to indicate a constructable asset.

+makeExample('style-guide/ts/03-01/app/shared/exception.service.avoid.ts', 'example', 'app/shared/exception.service.ts')(avoid=1)

  ### Constants
  <a id="03-02"></a>
  #### Style 03-02

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use uppercase with underscores when naming constants. 
    
.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Follows conventional thinking for constants.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Constants can easily be identified.

  ### Interfaces
  <a id="03-03"></a>
  #### Style 03-03

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** name an interface using upper camel case. 

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Consider** naming an interface without an `I` prefix. 

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** When we use types, we can often simply use the class as the type.

  #### Style 03-04

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use lower camel case to name properties and methods. 
    
.s-rule.avoid
  :marked
    **Avoid** prefixing private properties and methods with an underscore. 
    
.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Follows conventional thinking for properties and methods.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** JavaScript lacks a true private property or method. 

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** TypeScript tooling makes it easy to identify private vs public properties and methods.

  ### Import Destructuring Spacing
  <a id="03-05"></a>
  #### Style 03-05

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** leave one whitespace character inside of the `import` statements' curly braces when destructuring. 
    
.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Whitespace makes it easier to read the imports.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** list destructured imported assets alphabetized. 

.s-why

    **Why?** The empty line makes it easy to read and locate imports. 

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Alphabetizing makes it easier to read and locate imports.

  ## Application Structure

  Have a near term view of implementation and a long term vision. Start small but keep in mind on where the app is heading down the road. 
  
  All of the app's code goes in a root folder named `app`. All content is 1 feature per file. Each component, service, pipe is in its own file. All 3rd party vendor scripts are stored in another root folder and not in the `app` folder. We didn't write them and we don't want them cluttering our app. Use the naming conventions for file in this guide.

  ### LIFT
  <a id="04-01"></a>
  #### Style 04-01

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** structure the app such that we can `L`ocate our code quickly, `I`dentify the code at a glance, keep the `F`lattest structure we can, and `T`ry to stay DRY. 
    
.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** define the structure to follow these four basic guidelines, listed in order of importance.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** LIFT Provides a consistent structure that scales well, is modular, and makes it easier to increase developer efficiency by finding code quickly. Another way to check our app structure is to ask ourselves: How quickly can we open and work in all of the related files for a feature?

.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Locate
  <a id="04-02"></a>
  #### Style 04-02

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** make locating our code intuitive, simple and fast.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** We find this to be super important for a project. If our team cannot find the files we need to work on quickly, we will not be able to work as efficiently as possible, and the structure needs to change. We may not know the file name or where its related files are, so putting them in the most intuitive locations and near each other saves a ton of time. A descriptive folder structure can help with this.

a(href="#toc") Back to top

.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Identify
  <a id="04-03"></a>
  #### Style 04-03

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** name the file such that we instantly know what it contains and represents.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** be descriptive with file names and keeping the contents of the file to exactly one component.
     
.s-rule.avoid
  :marked
    **Avoid** files with multiple components, multiple services, or a mixture. 
    
.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** We spend less time hunting and pecking for code, and become more efficient. If this means we want longer file names, then so be it.

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    There are deviations of the 1 per file rule when we have a set of very small features that are all related to each other, as they are still easily identifiable.

  ### Flat
  <a id="04-04"></a>
  #### Style 04-04

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** keep a flat folder structure as long as possible. 
    
.s-rule.consider
  :marked
    **Consider** creating fodlers when we get to seven or more files.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Nobody wants to search 7 levels of folders to find a file. In a folder structure there is no hard and fast number rule, but when a folder has 7-10 files, that may be time to create subfolders. We base it on our comfort level. Use a flatter structure until there is an obvious value (to help the rest of LIFT) in creating a new folder.

  ### T-DRY (Try to Stick to DRY)
  <a id="04-05"></a>
  #### Style 04-05

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** be DRY
    
.s-rule.avoid
  :marked
    **Avoid** being so DRY that we sacrifice readability.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Being DRY is important, but not crucial if it sacrifices the others in LIFT, which is why we call it T-DRY. We don’t want to type `hero-view.component.html` for a view because, well, it’s obviously a view. If it is not obvious or by convention, then we name it.

  ### Overall Structural Guidelines
  <a id="04-06"></a>
  #### Style 04-06

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** start small but keep in mind where the app is heading down the road. 

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** have a near term view of implementation and a long term vision. 

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** put all of the app's code in a root folder named `app`. 

.s-rule.consider
  :marked
    **Consider** creating a folder for each component including its `.ts`, `.html`, `.css` and `.spec` file. 

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Helps keep the app small and easy to maintain in the early stages, while being easy to evolve as the app grows.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Components often have four files (e.g. `*.html`, `*.css`, `*.ts`, and `*.spec.ts`) and can clutter a folder quickly.

    While we prefer our Components to be in their own dedicated folder, another option for small apps is to keep Components flat (not in a dedicated folder). This adds up to four files to the existing folder, but also reduces the folder nesting. Be consistent.

  :marked
    **Do** create folders named for the feature they represent.

  ### Lazy Loaded Folders
  <a id="04-11"></a>
  #### Style 04-11
  A distinct application feature or workflow may be *lazy loaded* or *loaded on demand* rather than when the application starts.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** put the contents of lazy loaded features in a *lazy loaded folder*. 
    A typical *lazy loaded folder* contains a *routing component*, its child components, and their related assets and modules.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Lazy loaded code paths are easily distinguishable from non lazy loaded paths.

  #### Style 05-03

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** define Components as elements via the selector.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Components have templates containing HTML and optional Angular template syntax. They are most associated with putting content on a page, and thus are more closely aligned with elements.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Components are derived from Directives, and thus their selectors can be elements, attributes, or other selectors. Defining the selector as an element provides consistency for components that represent content with a template.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** It is easier to recognize that a symbol is a component vs a directive by looking at the template's html.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Syntax hints for inline templates in (*.js and *.ts) code files are not supported by some editors.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** A component file's logic is easier to read when not mixed with inline template and styles.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** place the `@Input()` or `@Output()` on the same line as the property they decorate.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** It is easier and more readable to idnetify which properties in a class are inputs or outputs.

.s-why

    **Why?** If we ever need to rename the name of the property, or event name associated to [`@Input`](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/Input-var.html) or respectively [`@Output`](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/Output-var.html) we can modify it on a single place.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** The metadata declaration attached to the directive is shorter and thus more readable.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Placing the decorator on the same line makes for shorter code and still easily identifies the property as an input or output.

    **Why?** This is consistent with built-in events such as button clicks.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Angular allows for an [alternative syntax](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/template-syntax.html#!#binding-syntax) `on-*`. If the event itself was prefixed with `on` this would result in an `on-onEvent` binding expression.

    **Do** use @HostListener and @HostBinding instead of the host property of the @Directive and @Component decorators:

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** The name of the property, or method name associated to @HostBinding or respectively @HostListener should be modified only in a single place - in the directive's controller. In contrast if we use host we need to modify both the property declaration inside the controller, and the metadata associated to the directive.

    **Do** use services as singletons within the same injector. Use them for sharing data and functionality.
    
.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Services are ideal for sharing methods across a feature area or an app.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Services are ideal for sharing stateful in-memory data.

  ### Single Responsibility
  <a id="07-02"></a>
  #### Style 07-02

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** create services with a single responsibility that is encapsulated by its context. 
    
.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** create a new service once the service begins to exceed that singular purpose.
    
.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** When a service has multiple responsibilities, it becomes difficult to test.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** When a service has multiple responsibilities, every Component or Service that injects it now carries the weight of them all.

  ### Providing a Service
  <a id="07-03"></a>
  #### Style 07-03

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** provide services to the Angular 2 injector at the top-most component where they will be shared.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** The Angular 2 injector is hierarchical.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** When providing the service to a top level component, that instance is shared and available to all child components of that top level component.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** This is ideal when a service is sharing methods and has no state, or state that must be shared.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** This is not ideal when two different components need different instances of a service. In this scenario it would be better to provide the service at the component level that needs the new and separate instance.

  ### Use the @Injectable() Class Decorator
  <a id="07-04"></a>
  #### Style 07-04

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use the `@Injectable` class decorator instead of the `@Inject` parameter decorator when we are using types as tokens for the dependencies of a service.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** The Angular DI mechanism resolves all the dependencies of our services based on their types declared with the services' constructors.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** When a service accepts only dependencies associated with type tokens, the `@Injectable()` syntax is much less verbose compared to using `@Inject()` on each individual constructor parameter.

  ## Data Services

  ### Separate Data Calls
  <a id="08-01"></a>
  #### Style 08-01

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** refactor logic for making data operations and interacting with data to a service. 
    
.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** make data services responsible for XHR calls, local storage, stashing in memory, or any other data operations.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** The component's responsibility is for the presentation and gathering of information for the view. It should not care how it gets the data, just that it knows who to ask for it. Separating the data services moves the logic on how to get it to the data service, and lets the component be simpler and more focused on the view.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** This makes it easier to test (mock or real) the data calls when testing a component that uses a data service.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Data service implementation may have very specific code to handle the data repository. This may include headers, how to talk to the data, or other services such as `Http`. Separating the logic into a data service encapsulates this logic in a single place hiding the implementation from the outside consumers (perhaps a component), also making it easier to change the implementation.

  ### Implement Lifecycle Hooks Interfaces
  <a id="09-01"></a>
  #### Style 09-01

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** implement the lifecycle hook interfaces.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** We will avoid unintentionally not calling the hook if we misspell the method.

  ## Routing
  
  Client-side routing is important for creating a navigation flow between a component tree hierarchy, and composing components that are made of many other child components.

  ### Component Router
  <a id="10-01"></a>
  #### Style 10-01

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** separate route configuration into a routing component file, also known as a component router.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use a `<router-outlet>` in the component router, where the routes will have their component targets display their templates.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** focus the logic in the component router to the routing aspects and its target components. 

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** extract other logic to services and other components.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** A component that handles routing is known as the component router, thus this follows the Angular 2 routing pattern.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** A component that handles routing is known as the componenter router.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** The `<router-outlet>` indicates where the template should be displayed for the target route.
