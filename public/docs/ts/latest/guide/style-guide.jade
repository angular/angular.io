  Welcome to the Angular Style Guide

  ## Purpose

  Looking for an opinionated guide to Angular syntax, conventions, and application structure?
  Step right in!
  This style guide presents our preferred conventions and, as importantly, explains why.

  ## Style vocabulary

  Each guideline describes either a good or bad practice, and all have a consistent presentation.

  The wording of each guideline indicates how strong the recommendation is.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** is one that should always be followed.
    _Always_ might be a bit too strong of a word.
    Guidelines that literally should always be followed are extremely rare.
    On the other hand, you need a really unusual case for breaking a *Do* guideline.

.s-rule.consider
  :marked
    **Consider** guidelines should generally be followed.
    If you fully understand the meaning behind the guideline and have a good reason to deviate, then do so. Please strive to be consistent.

.s-rule.avoid
  :marked
    **Avoid** indicates something you should almost never do. Code examples to *avoid* have an unmistakeable red header.
.l-main-section

:marked
  ## File structure conventions

  Some code examples display a file that has one or more similarly named companion files. 
  For example, `hero.component.ts` and `hero.component.html`.

  The guideline will use the shortcut `hero.component.ts|html|css|spec` to represent those various files. Using this shortcut makes this guide's file structures easier to read and more terse.

  ## Single responsibility

  Apply the 
  <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" target="_blank"><i>Single Responsibility Principle</i> (SPR)</a>
  to all components, services, and other symbols. 
  This helps make the app cleaner, easier to read and maintain, and more testable.

  ### <a id="01-01"></a>_Rule of One_
  #### <a href="#01-01">Style 01-01</a>
.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** define one thing, such as a service or component, per file.

.s-rule.consider
  :marked
    **Consider** limiting files to 400 lines of code.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** One component per file makes it far easier to read, maintain, and avoid 
    collisions with teams in source control.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** One component per file avoids hidden bugs that often arise when combining components in a file where they may share variables, create unwanted closures, or unwanted coupling with dependencies.

.s-why.s-why-last
  :marked
    **Why?** A single component can be the default export for its file which facilitates lazy loading with the router.
:marked
  The key is to make the code more reusable, easier to read, and less mistake prone.

  The following *negative* example defines the `AppComponent`, bootstraps the app, defines the `Hero` model object, and loads heroes from the server ... all in the same file. *Don't do this*.

+makeExample('style-guide/ts/01-01/app/heroes/hero.component.avoid.ts', '', 'app/heroes/hero.component.ts')(avoid=1)
:marked
  It is a better practice to redistribute the component and its 
  supporting classes into their own, dedicated files.

+makeTabs(
  `style-guide/ts/01-01/main.ts,
  style-guide/ts/01-01/app/app.module.ts,
  style-guide/ts/01-01/app/app.component.ts,

  app/heroes/heroes.component.ts,
  app/heroes/shared/hero.service.ts,
  app/heroes/shared/hero.model.ts,
  app/heroes/shared/mock-heroes.ts`)

:marked
  As the app grows, this rule becomes even more important.

  ### <a id="01-02"></a>Small functions
  #### <a href="#01-02">Style 01-02</a>
.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** define small functions

.s-rule.consider
  :marked
    **Consider** limiting to no more than 75 lines.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Small functions are easier to test, especially when they do one thing and serve one purpose.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Small functions promote reuse.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Small functions are easier to read.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Small functions are easier to maintain.

.s-why.s-why-last
  :marked
    **Why?** Small functions help avoid hidden bugs that come with large functions that share variables with external scope, create unwanted closures, or unwanted coupling with dependencies.

  ## Naming

  Naming conventions are hugely important to maintainability and readability. This guide recommends naming conventions for the file name and the symbol name.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ### <a id="02-01"></a>General Naming Guidelines
  #### <a href="#02-01">Style 02-01</a>

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use consistent names for all symbols.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** follow a pattern that describes the symbol's feature then its type. The recommended pattern is `feature.type.ts`.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Naming conventions help provide a consistent way to find content at a glance. Consistency within the project is vital. Consistency with a team is important. Consistency across a company provides tremendous efficiency.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** The naming conventions should simply help find desited code faster and make it easier to understand.

.s-why.s-why-last
  :marked
    **Why?** Names of folders and files should clearly convey their intent. For example, `app/heroes/hero-list.component.ts` may contain a component that manages a list of heroes.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ### <a id="02-02"></a>Separate file names with dots and dashes
  #### <a href="#02-02">Style 02-02</a>

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use dashes to separate words in the descriptive name.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use dots to separate the descriptive name from the type.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use consistent type names for all components following a pattern that describes the component's feature then its type. A recommended pattern is `feature.type.ts`.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use conventional type names including `.service`, `.component`, `.pipe`, `.module`, and `.directive`. 
    Invent additional type names if you must but take care not to create too many.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Type names provide a consistent way to quickly identify what is in the file.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Type names make it easy to find a specific file type using an editor or IDE's fuzzy search techniques.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Unabbreviated type names such as `.service` are descriptive and unambiguous.
    Abbreviations such as `.srv`, `.svc`, and `.serv` can be confusing.

.s-why.s-why-last
  :marked
    **Why?** Type names provide pattern matching for any automated tasks.

.l-main-section

  ### <a id="02-03"></a>Symbols and file names
  #### <a href="#02-03">Style 02-03</a>

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use consistent names for all assets named after what they represent.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use upper camel case for class names.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** match the name of the symbol to the name of the file.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** append the symbol name with the conventional suffix (such as `Component`, 
    `Directive`, `Module`, `Pipe`, or `Service`) for a thing of that type.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** give the filename the conventional suffix (such as `.component.ts`, `.directive.ts`, 
    `.module.ts`, `.pipe.ts`, or `.service.ts`) for a file of that type.
.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Consistent conventions make it easy to quickly identify 
    and reference assets of different types.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use consistent names for all services named after their feature.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** suffix a service class name with Service. 
    For example, something that gets data or heroes 
    should be called a `DataService` or a `HeroService`.

    A few terms are unambiguously services. They typically 
    indicate agency by ending in "er". You may prefer to name 
    a service that logs messages `Logger` rather than `LoggerService`. 
    Decide if this exception is agreeable in your project. 
    As always, strive for consistency.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Provides a consistent way to quickly identify and reference services.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Clear service names such as `Logger` do not require a suffix.

.s-why.s-why-last
  :marked
    **Why?** Service names such as `Credit` are nouns and require a suffix and should be named with a suffix when it is not obvious if it is a service or something else.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** include error handling in the bootstrapping logic.

.s-rule.avoid
  :marked
    **Avoid** putting app logic in the `main.ts`. Instead, consider placing it in a component or service.

.s-why

    **Why?** Follows a consistent convention for the startup logic of an app.

.s-why.s-why-last

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** Use lower camel case for naming the selectors of directives.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Keeps the names of the properties defined in the directives that are bound to the view consistent with the attribute names.

.s-why.s-why-last

    **Do** use a hyphenated, lowercase element selector value (e.g. `admin-users`). 
    

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use a custom prefix for a component selector. 
    For example, the prefix `toh` represents from **T**our **o**f **H**eroes and the prefix `admin` represents an admin feature area.

.s-rule.do
  :marked
    **Do** use a prefix that identifies the feature area or the app itself.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Prevents element name collisions with components in other apps and with native HTML elements.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Makes it easier to promote and share the component in other apps.

.s-why.s-why-last

    **Consider** spelling `const` variables in lower camel case.

.s-why

    **Why?** Lower camel case variable names (`heroRoutes`) are easier to read and understand

.s-why.s-why-last
  :marked
    **Why?** The tradition of naming constants in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE reflects
    an era before the modern IDEs that quickly reveal the `const` declaration.
    TypeScript itself prevents accidental reassignment.

.s-why.s-why-last

    **Why?** The tradition of UPPER_SNAKE_CASE remains popular and pervasive,
    especially in third party modules.
    It is rarely worth the effort to change them at the risk of breaking existing code and documentation.

  ## Application structure and Angular modules

  Have a near-term view of implementation and a long-term vision. Start small but keep in mind where the app is heading down the road.

  All of the app's code goes in a folder named `app`. 
  All feature areas are in their own folder, with their own Angular module. 
  
  All content is one asset per file. Each component, service, and pipe is in its own file. 
  All third party vendor scripts are stored in another folder and not in the `app` folder. 
  You didn't write them and you don't want them cluttering `app`. 
  Use the naming conventions for files in this guide.

    **Why?** LIFT Provides a consistent structure that scales well, is modular, and makes it easier to increase developer efficiency by finding code quickly.

    To work efficiently you must be able to find files quickly, 
    especially when you do not know (or do not remember) the file _names_. 
    Keeping related files near each other in an intuitive location saves time. 
    A descriptive folder structure makes a world of difference to you and the people who come after you.

    **Why?** Spend less time hunting and pecking for code, and become more efficient. 
    Longer file names are far better than _short-but-obscure_ abbreviated names.

.l-sub-section

    It may be advantageous to deviate from the _one-thing-per-file_ rule when

    **Consider** configuring the IDE to hide distracting, irrelevant files such as generated `.js` and `.js.map` files.

.s-why.s-why-last

    A flat structure is easy to scan.

    On the other hand,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two" target="_blank">psychologists believe</a>
    that humans start to struggle when the number of adjacent interesting things exceeds nine.
    So when a folder has ten or more files, it may be time to create subfolders. 
    
    Base your decision on your comfort level. 
    Use a flatter structure until there is an obvious value to creating a new folder.

    That's why it's called _T-DRY_.

    While components in dedicated folders are widely preferred, 
    another option for small apps is to keep components flat (not in a dedicated folder). 
    This adds up to four files to the existing folder, but also reduces the folder nesting. 
    Whatever you choose, be consistent.

.s-rule.consider

    **Consider** calling the application-wide core module, `CoreModule`.

    **Do** import all modules required by the assets in the `CoreModule` (e.g. `CommonModule` and `FormsModule`).

    Import it once (in the `AppModule`) when the app starts and never import it anywhere else. (e.g. `NavComponent` and `SpinnerComponent`).

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** Real world apps can have several single-use components (e.g., spinners, message toasts, and modal dialogs) that appear only in the `AppComponent` template.

    **Avoid** importing the `CoreModule` anywhere except in the `AppModule`.

    `AppModule` is a little smaller because many app/root classes have moved to other modules. 
    `AppModule` is stable because you will add future components and providers to other modules, not this one. 
    `AppModule` delegates to imported modules rather than doing work. 
    `AppModule` is focused on its main task, orchestrating the app as a whole.

.s-why

    **Why?** Large, inline templates and styles obscure the component's purpose and implementation, reducing readability and maintainability.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** In most editors, syntax hints and code snippets aren't available when developing inline templates and styles.
    The Angular TypeScript Language Service (forthcoming) promises to overcome this deficiency for HTML templates
    in those editors that support it; it won't help with CSS styles.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** A _component relative_ URL requires no change when you move the component files, as long as the files stay together.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** The JIT compiler requires the `moduleId` for relative URLs; the AOT compiler, 
    which doesn't need it, safely ignores this property.

.s-why.s-why-last

    **Why?** The `./` prefix is standard syntax for relative URLs; don't depend on Angular's current ability to do without that prefix.

.s-why
  :marked
    **Why?** The component's responsibility is for the presentation and gathering of information for the view. It should not care how it gets the data, just that it knows who to ask for it. Separating the data services moves the logic on how to get it to the data service, and lets the component be simpler and more focused on the view.

.s-why

    **Why?** This makes it easier to test (mock or real) the data calls when testing a component that uses a data service.

.s-why.s-why-last

    **Why?** The details of data management, such as headers, HTTP methods, 
    caching, error handling, and retry logic, are irrelevant to components 
    and other data consumers.

    A data service encapsulates these details. It's easier to evolve these 
    details inside the service without affecting its consumers. And it's 
    easier to test the consumers with mock service implementations.
