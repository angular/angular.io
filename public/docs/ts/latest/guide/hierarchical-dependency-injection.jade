  You learned the basics of Angular Dependency injection in the
  [Dependency Injection](./dependency-injection.html) guide.

  Angular has a _Hierarchical Dependency Injection_ system.
  There is actually a tree of injectors that parallel an application's component tree.
  You can reconfigure the injectors at any level of that component tree.

  This guide explores this system and how to use it to your advantage.

  Try the <live-example></live-example>.

  ## The injector tree

  In the [Dependency Injection](./dependency-injection.html) guide,
  you learned how to configure a dependency injector and how to retrieve dependencies where you need them.

  In fact, there is no such thing as *the* injector.
  An application may have multiple injectors.
  An Angular application is a tree of components. Each component instance has its own injector!
  The tree of components parallels the tree of injectors.

:marked
  Consider this guide's variation on the Tour of Heroes application.
  At the top is the `AppComponent` which has some sub-components.
  One of them is the `HeroesListComponent`.
  The `HeroesListComponent` holds and manages multiple instances of the `HeroCardComponent`.
  The following diagram represents the state of the this guide's three-level component tree when there are three instances of `HeroCardComponent`
  open simultaneously.

  Angular doesn't actually _create_ a separate injector for each component.
  Every component doesn't need its own injector and it would be horribly inefficient to create
  masses of injectors for no good purpose.

  But every component _has an injector_, even if it shares that injector with another component or with the injector of the root `AppModule`.
  And there _may_ be multiple injector instances operating at different levels of the component tree 
  depending upon how the developer registers providers, which is the subject of this guide.

  ### Injector bubbling  

  When a component requests a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with a provider registered in that component's own injector.
  If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's injector.
  If that injector can't satisfy the request, it passes it along to *its* parent injector.
  The requests keep bubbling up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor injectors.
  If it runs out of ancestors, Angular throws an error.

.l-sub-section

    You can cap the bubbling. An intermediate component can declare that it is the "host" component.
    The hunt for providers will climb no higher than the injector for that host component.
    This a topic for another day.

  ### Re-providing a service at different levels
  You can re-register a provider for a particular dependency token at multiple levels of the injector tree.
  You don't *have* to re-register providers. You shouldn't do so unless you have a good reason. 
  But you *can*.

  As the resolution logic works upwards, the first provider encountered wins.
  Thus, a provider in an intermediate injector intercepts a request for a service from something lower in the tree.
  It effectively "reconfigures" and "shadows" a provider at a higher level in the tree.

  If you only specify providers at the top level (typically the root `AppModule`), the tree of injectors appears to be flat. 
  All requests bubble up to the root <span if-docs="ts"><code>NgModule</code></span> injector that you configured with the `!{_bootstrapModule}` method.

  ## Component injectors

  The ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up interesting and useful possibilities.

:marked
  ### Scenario: service isolation

  Architectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs.

  The guide sample includes a `VillainsListComponent` that displays a list of villains.
  It gets those villains from a `VillainsService`.

  While you could provide `VillainsService` in the root `AppModule` (that's where you'll find the `HeroesService`), 
  that would make the `VillainsService` available everywhere in the application, including the _Hero_ workflows.

  If you later modify the `VillainsService`, you could break something in a hero component somewhere.
  That's not supposed to happen but the way you've provided the service creates that risk.

  Instead, provide the `VillainsService` in the `providers` metadata of the `VillainsListComponent` like this:

+makeExample('hierarchical-dependency-injection/ts/app/villains-list.component.ts', 'metadata','app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)')(format='.')
:marked
  By providing `VillainsService` in the `VillainsListComponent` metadata &mdash; and nowhere else &mdash;, 
  the service becomes available only in the `VillainsListComponent` and its sub-component tree.
  It's still a singleton, but it's a singleton that exist solely in the _villain_ domain.

  You are confident that a hero component can't access it. You've reduced your exposure to error.

  ### Scenario: multiple edit sessions

  Many applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time.
  For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working several tax returns,
  switching from one to the other throughout the day.

  A `TaxReturnComponent` could delegate the working state of an open return to a dedicated instance of a `TaxReturnStateService`.
  Each open tax return is managed in its own instance of a `TaxReturnComponent` with its own instance of the `TaxReturnStateService`.

  This guide demonstrates that scenario with an example in the Tour of Heroes theme.
  Imagine an outer `HeroListComponent` that displays a list of super heroes.
  Each hero has a name and a super power.

  To edit a hero, the user clicks on a hero name, which opens a card for editing that hero. 
  Each selected hero opens in its own card and multiple cards can be open at the same time.
  You can even open multiple cards for the same hero (probably not a great experience).

  Each card
  * is its own _hero editing session_.
  * can change a hero without affecting a hero in another card ... even if that other card edits the "same" hero.
  * has the ability to save the changes to its hero (thus updating the master list of heroes) or cancel them.

figure.image-display
  img(src="/resources/images/devguide/dependency-injection/hid-sample-anim.gif" alt="Sample in action")
:marked
  This implies that the card has logic to manage and restore changes. 
  That's a pretty easy task for a simple `hero` class. 
  In the real world, with complex entities (such as tax returns), the change management can be tricky.
  You might delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.

  Here is the `HeroStateService`. It caches a single `Hero`, tracks changes to that hero, and 
  can save or restore that hero.
+makeExample('hierarchical-dependency-injection/ts/app/hero-state.service.ts', '', 'app/hero-state.service.ts')

:marked
  Notice that it also delegates to the application-wide, singleton `HeroService`, which it gets by injection.

  Here is the `HeroCardComponent` that uses it.
+makeExample('hierarchical-dependency-injection/ts/app/hero-card.component.ts', null, 'app/hero-card.component.ts')

:marked
  The _hero-to-edit_ arrives via the input property which is implemented with getters and setters.
  The setter initializes the component's own instance of the `HeroStateService` with the incoming hero.
  The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero.
  The component also asks the service to save and restore this hero.

  There'd be big trouble if _this_ service were an application wide singleton.
  Every card would share the same service instance. 
  Each card would overwrite the hero that belonged to another card.
  What a mess!

  Look closely at the metadata for the `HeroCardComponent`. Notice the `providers` property.

+makeExample('hierarchical-dependency-injection/ts/app/hero-card.component.ts', 'providers')
:marked
  The component has its own provider of the `HeroStateService`. 
  Recall that every component _instance_ has its own injector. 
  Providing the service at the component level ensures that _every_ instance of the component gets its own, private instance of the service.
  No hero overwriting. No mess.

    The rest of the _hero_ scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation.

  ### Scenario: specialized providers

  Another reason to re-provide a service is to substitute a _more specialized_ implementation of that service,
  deeper in the component tree.

  Consider again the Car example from the [Dependency Injection](./dependency-injection.html) guide.
  Suppose you configured the root injector (marked as A) with _generic_ providers for 
  `CarService`, `EngineService` and `TiresService`.

  You create a car component (A) that displays a car constructed from these three generic services.

  Then you create a child component (B) that defines its own, _specialized_ providers for `CarService` and `EngineService`
  that have special capabilites suitable for whatever is going on in component (B).

  Component (B) is the parent of another component (C) that defines its own, even _more specialized_ provider for `CarService`.

  img(src="/resources/images/devguide/dependency-injection/car-components.png" alt="car components" width="220")

:marked
  Behind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.

  When you resolve an instance of `Car` at the deepest component (C),
  its injector produces an instance of `Car` resolved by injector (C) with an `Engine` resolved by injector (B) and
  `Tires` resolved by the root injector (A).
