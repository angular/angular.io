  With internationalization, also known as i18n, we can display our website in multiple languages.
  Angular provides tools to export translation files that translators and work on.
  Those finished translations can then be loaded alongside with your application to make it
  available to multiple audiences.

  ## Angular and i18n

  Angular allows us to replace text in our application with the translation of our choice. 
  
  We would usually start with a working application that already has text in a single language. 
  We then we extract from our app a translation file that translators can load on their translation software to work on the translation.
  Finally we use their translation on our app to override the original text.

  We can then build the application for each language we need, and deploy each translated application to it's own server.

  ### i18n attribute
  
  The `i18n` attribute is what tells Angular where it should insert the translations.

  We'll start with a simple greeting in a `<h1>` tag:

+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/app.component.1.html', 'greeting', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

:marked
  We simply add the attribute `i18n` to our tag to mark it as a translation point.

+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/app.component.1.html', 'i18n-attribute', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

:marked
  To help the translators, we can add more information about the meaning and context of this string.
  Simply add a description to the i18n attribute:
  
+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/app.component.1.html', 'i18n-attribute-desc', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

:marked
  We can add some meaning as well, separate the meaning from the description with the `|` character:
  
+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/app.component.html', 'i18n-attribute-meaning', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

:marked
  While the same text with the same meaning should have the same translation, 
  the same text with *different meanings* can have different translations.
  Both the meaning and the description will be extracted by our messages extractor and added to the messages file.
  
  This will help our translators to translate our application with a better understanding of what our text means.   


a(id="ng-xi18n")
.l-main-section

  ### Extract messages with ng-xi18n
  
  Now that our template has been updated to support i18n translations, we can use the `ng-xi18n` messages extractor.
  
  This CLI tool is based on `ngc`, and is available in the `@angular/compiler-cli` npm package.
  You can read more about `ngc` on the [AoT cookbook](../cookbook/aot-compiler.html).
  
  To use it, the first thing that we have to do is to install it and it's `platform-server` peer dependency:
  
code-example(language="sh").
  npm install @angular/compiler-cli @angular/platform-server --save

:marked
  Like `ngc`, `ng-xi18n` is based on `tsc`, the TypeScript compiler. 
  We can use it to generate our transfile file at the root of our project:
 
code-example(language="sh").
  ./node_modules/.bin/ng-xi18n

:marked
  The translation file is generated by default in the format `XML Localisation Interchange File Format` (XLIFF, version 1.2).
  
  `ng-x18n` and Angular also supports the `XML Message Bundle`(XMB) format. We can switch to this 
  format by adding the `--i18nFormat=xmb` to our command.  
  
.alert.is-helpful
  :marked
    It is considered good practice to create a new npm command that will be used to run `ng-xi18n`.
    
    Edit `package.json` and add the following command in the `scripts` property: `"extract": "ng-xi18n"`.
    We can now generate our translations using the command `npm run extract`.


a(id="translate")
.l-main-section

  ### Translate le message
  
  Now that we have generated a `./messages.xlf` file we could edit it, or send it to 
  translators to edit, using one of the many editors that support `xlf`. 
  You can find a list of editors [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLIFF#Editors).
  
  For the sake of simplicity, we will make our French by editing the translation file manually in our text editor.

  Make a copy of `messages.xlf` called `messages.fr.xlf`, open it and find the following section:

  ```
  <trans-unit id="af2ccf4b5dba59616e92cf1531505af02da8f6d2" datatype="html">
    <source>Hello i18n!</source>
    <target/>
    <note priority="1" from="description">An introduction header for this sample</note>
    <note priority="1" from="meaning">User welcome</note>
  </trans-unit>
  ``` 

  This XML element represents the translation of our header tag. 
  You might have a different string in `id="af2ccf4b5dba59616e92cf1531505af02da8f6d2"`, this is normal.

  Replace `<target/>` with `<target>Bonjour i18n!</target>` to add our French translation.
  That's all for our french translation!

    Whenever we add new messages - or edit existing ones - in our application, we have to repeat this process.

    Using specialized translation software can help us find out easily what new translations have been generated by
    the messages extractor.

  ## Loading translations

  Now that we have a localized file, we can tell Angular to use it for all of our elements that have the `i18n` marker.
  
  Angular understands `xlf`,`xlif` and `xtb` formats, but we have to provide these message into our application.

  However, our paths diverge depending on whether we use JiT or AoT: 
  
    * if we are using Just-in-Time compilation, we must incorporate our translation file content into
    our application code at bootstrap time.
    * if we are using Ahead-in-Time compilation, we can include our translation file via `ngc` options. 

  In both approaches the general idea is the same. we have to give angular these three things:
    * Translations file
    * Translation format 
    * Locale ID

  Our untranslated app now looks like this:

+makeTabs(`
  i18n/ts/app/app.component.html,
  i18n/ts/app/app.component.ts,
  i18n/ts/app/app.module.ts,
  i18n/ts/app/main.1.ts,
  i18n/ts/messages.fr.xlf.ts
`, '', `
  app/app.component.html,
  app/app.component.ts,
  app/app.module.ts,
  app/main.ts,
  messages.fr.xlf
`)

a(id="use-jit")
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Load translations with the JiT approach
  
  When we use JiT, we'll provide those three things when bootstrapping out `AppModule`.

  We have to provide three values: `TRANSLATIONS`, `TRANSLATIONS_FORMAT` and `LOCALE_ID`.
    * `TRANSLATIONS` is a string containing the content of our `messages` file for the chosen localization.
    * `TRANSLATIONS_FORMAT` is either `xlf`, `xlif` or `xtb` depending on the format of our `messages` file.
    * `LOCALE_ID` is a string representing the locale of our chosen language.

  Starting out with our default `main.ts`:
  
+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/main.1.ts', null, 'app/main.ts')(format=".")

:marked
  We'll import `TRANSLATIONS`, `TRANSLATIONS_FORMAT` and `LOCALE_ID` from `@angular/core`, then
  use them to provide our own values in the `providers` array: 
  
+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/main.ts', null, 'app/main.ts')(format=".")

:marked
  But... We don't have a `./messages.fr.ts` file yet. 

  Since TypeScript is unable to import an `xlf` file, we have to create a `.ts` file that exports the content of our
  `messages.fr.xlf` file.

  Create `app/messages.fr.ts`. We just want to export a string, so we'll start out with a very 
  simple file exporting an empty template literal:

+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/messages.fr.1.ts', null, 'app/messages.fr.ts')(format=".")

:marked
  Now copy the contents of `message.fr.xlf` into the empty template literal:

+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/messages.fr.ts', null, 'app/messages.fr.ts')(format=".")

.alert.is-helpful
  :marked
    If you use Webpack you can use the [raw loader](https://github.com/webpack/raw-loader) to import your translations
    file directly like this: `const TRANSLATION = require("raw!./i18n/messages.fr.xlf");`

:marked
  That's it, our application is now internationalized! Angular will replace the content of our elements using
  the `i18n` attribute with the french translations that we provided at bootstrap.

  Your JiT app should now look just like the app at the end of [Loading translations](#loading-translations)
  except for these two files:

+makeTabs(`
    i18n/ts/app/main.ts,
    i18n/ts/app/messages.fr.ts
  `, '', `
    app/main.ts,
    app/messages.fr.ts
  `)

a(id="use-aot")
.l-main-section

  ### Use translations with the AoT approach
  
  Using the AoT approach requires a little bit of setup to make the `ngc` compiler work. Start with 
  the files shown at the end of [Loading translations](#loading-translations) and refer to the
  [AoT cookbook](../cookbook/aot-compiler.html) to make it AoT ready.
  
  Once our project is AoT-ready, we will use `ngc` to compile a version of our application per locale. To do that
  we will add three arguments to the cli command:
    * `--i18nFile`: the path to our localization file
    * `--locale`: the name of the locale
    * `--i18nFormat`: the format of our localization file
  
code-example(language="sh").
  ./node_modules/.bin/ngc --i18nFile=./messages.fr.xlf --locale=fr --i18nFormat=xlf
  
:marked
  That's all that we have to do! The `ngc` compiler will replace the content of our elements that have
  the i18n attribute  with our translations in the AoT precompiled files.
