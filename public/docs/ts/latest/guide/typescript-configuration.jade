  TypeScript is a primary language for Angular application development. It is a dialect of JavaScript with design-time support for type-safety and tooling.
  
  Browsers can't execute TypeScript directly. Typescript must be "transpiled" into JavaScript using the *tsc* compiler,
  which requires some configuration.
  
  This page covers some aspects of TypeScript configuration and the TypeScript environment
  that are important to Angular developers, including details about the following files:
  
  * [tsconfig.json](#tsconfig) - TypeScript compiler configuration.
  * [typings](#typings) - TypesScript declaration files.

  ## *tsconfig.json*
  Typically, you add a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) to your project to
  guide the compiler as it generates JavaScript files.

    For details about `tsconfig.json`, see the official
    [TypeScript wiki](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html).

  We created the following `tsconfig.json` for [QuickStart](../quickstart.html):

  This file contains options and flags that are essential for Angular 2 applications.

  ### *noImplicitAny* and *suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors*

  TypeScript developers disagree about whether the `noImplicitAny` flag should be `true` or `false`.
  There is no correct answer and you can change the flag later.
  But your choice now can make a difference in larger projects, so it merits discussion.

  When the `noImplicitAny` flag is `false` (the default), and if
  the compiler cannot infer the variable type based on how it's used, the compiler silently defaults the type to `any`. That's what is meant by *implicit `any`*.

  In the QuickStart exercise, the `noImplicitAny` flag is initialized to `false`
  to make learning TypeScript development easier.
  
  When the `noImplicitAny` flag is `true` and the TypeScript compiler cannot infer
  the type, it still generates the JavaScript files, but it also **reports an error**.
  Many seasoned developers prefer this stricter setting because type checking catches more
  unintentional errors at compile time.
  
  You can set a variable's type to `any` even when the `noImplicitAny` flag is `true`.

  If you set the `noImplicitAny` flag to `true`, you may get *implicit index errors* as well.
  Most developers feel that *this particular error* is more annoying than helpful.
  You can suppress them with the following additional flag:
code-example(format=".").
  "suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors":true

  ## TypeScript Typings
  Many JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery, the Jasmine testing library, and Angular,
  extend the JavaScript environment with features and syntax
  that the TypeScript compiler doesn't recognize natively.
  When the compiler doesn't recognize something, it throws an error. 
  
  Use [TypeScript type definition files](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/writing-declaration-files.html)&mdash;`d.ts files`&mdash;to tell the compiler about the libraries you load.
  
  TypeScript-aware editors leverage these same definition files to display type information about library features.
  
  Many libraries include definition files in their npm packages where both the TypeScript compiler and editors
  can find them. Angular is one such library. 
  The `node_modules/@angular/core/` folder of any Angular application contains several `d.ts` files that describe parts of Angular.
  
  **You need do nothing to get *typings* files for library packages that include `d.ts` files&mdash;as all Angular packages do.**
  
  ### Installable typings files
  Many libraries&mdash;jQuery, Jasmine, and Lodash among them&mdash;do *not* include `d.ts` files in their npm packages.
  Fortunately, either their authors or community contributors have created separate `d.ts` files for these libraries and 
  published them in well-known locations.
  The *typings* tool can find and fetch these files for you.
  
  After installing the [typings](https://github.com/typings/typings/blob/master/README.md) tool 
  with npm (it's listed among the *devDependencies* in the `package.json`), add an npm script (`postinstall`)
  to run that tool automatically, after *npm* installation finishes.
+makeJson('quickstart/ts/package.1.json', {paths: 'scripts.postinstall'}, 'package.json (postinstall)')(format=".")
:marked
  This *typings* tool command, `typings install`, installs the `d.ts` files into the **typings** folder.
  You created a `typings.json` file in the [QuickStart](../quickstart.html):
+makeJson('quickstart/ts/typings.1.json', null, 'typings.json')(format=".")
:marked
  QuickStart identified three *typings* (`d.ts`) files:
  
  * [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/master/README.md)
  brings ES2015/ES6 capabilities to ES5 browsers
  
  * [jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) typings for the Jasmine test framework
  
  * [node](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/node/node.d.ts) for code that references objects in the *nodejs* environment; 
  You can view an example in the [webpack](./webpack.html) page.
  
  QuickStart doesn't require these typings but many of the samples do.

  You can also run the *typings* tool yourself.
  If the `postInstall` command fails to (re)install the typings files, run the following command to do so.
code-example(format="").
  npm run typings install
:marked
  Run this command to list the installed typings files:
code-example(format="").
  npm run typings list
:marked
  The following command installs or updates the typings file for the Jasmine test library from the *DefinitelyTyped* repository,
  and updates the `typings.config` file so you receive it automatically the next time you install typings.
code-example(format="").
  npm run typings -- install dt~jasmine --save --global

    The [&ndash;&ndash; option](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) tells npm to pass all arguments to the right of `--` to the *typings* command.
