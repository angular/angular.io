  **This is the archived version of the Angular documentation for Angular v2.**
  
  Please go to [angular.io](https://angular.io) for the current Angular release.

  ## All mention of moduleId removed. "Component relative paths" cookbook deleted (2017-03-13)
  We added a new SystemJS plugin (systemjs-angular-loader.js) to our recommended SystemJS configuration.
  This plugin dynamically converts "component-relative" paths in templateUrl and styleUrls to "absolute paths" for you.

  We strongly encourage you to only write component-relative paths.
  That is the only form of URL discussed in these docs. You no longer need to write @Component({ moduleId: module.id }), nor should you.

  ## NEW: Downloadable examples for each guide (2017-02-28)
  Now you can download the sample code for any guide and run it locally.
  Look for the new download links next to the "live example" links.

  ## Template Syntax/Structural Directives: refreshed (2017-02-06)
  The [_Template-Syntax_](template-syntax.html) and [_Structural Directives_](structural-directives.html)
  guides were significantly revised for clarity, accuracy, and current recommended practices.
  Discusses `<ng-container>`.
  Revised samples are more clear and cover all topics discussed.
  
  ## NEW: Samples re-structured with `src/` folder (2017-02-02)
  All documentation samples have been realigned with the default folder structure of the Angular CLI.
  That's a step along the road to basing the sample in the Angular CLI.
  But it's also good in its own right. 
  It helps clearly separate app code from setup and configuration files.

  All samples now have a `src/` folder at the project root.
  The former `app/` folder moves under `src/`. 
  Read about moving your existing project to this structure in 
  <a href="https://github.com/angular/quickstart#updating-to-a-newer-version-of-the-quickstart-repo" target="_blank" target="Migrating samples/quickstart app to the src folder">
  the QuickStart repo update instructions</a>.

  Notably:
  * `app/main.ts` moved to `src/main.ts`.
  * `app/` moved to `src/app/`.
  * `index.html`, `styles.css` and `tsconfig.json` moved inside `src/`.
  * `systemjs.config.js` now imports `main.js` instead of `app`.
  * Added `lite-server` configuration (`bs-config.json`) to serve `src/`.

  ## NEW: Reactive Forms guide (2017-01-31)
  The new [**Reactive Forms**](reactive-forms.html) guide explains how and why to build a "reactive form".
  "Reactive Forms" are the code-based counterpart to the declarative "Template Driven" forms approach
  introduced in the [Forms](forms.html) guide.
  Check it out before you decide how to add forms to your app. 
  Remember also that you can use both techniques in the same app, 
  choosing the approach that best fits each scenario.

  ## NEW: Deployment guide (2017-01-30)
  The new [Deployment](deployment.html) guide describes techniques for putting your application on a server.
  It includes important advice on optimizing for production.

  ## Hierarchical Dependency Injection: refreshed (2017-01-13)
  [Hierarchical Dependency Injection](hierarchical-dependency-injection.html) guide is significantly revised.
  Closes issue #3086.
  Revised samples are clearer and cover all topics discussed.

  ## Miscellaneous (2017-01-05)
  * [Setup](setup.html) guide: 
  added (optional) instructions on how to remove _non-essential_ files. 
  * No longer consolidate RxJS operator imports in `rxjs-extensions` file; each file should import what it needs.
  * All samples prepend template/style URLs with `./` as a best practice.
  * [Style Guide](style-guide.html): copy edits and revised rules.

  ## Router: more detail (2016-12-21)
  Added more information to the [Router](router.html) guide 
  including sections named outlets, wildcard routes, and preload strategies.

  ## HTTP: how to set default request headers (and other request options) (2016-12-14)
  Added section on how to set default request headers (and other request options) to 
  [HTTP](server-communication.html#override-default-request-options) guide.

  ## Testing: added component test plunkers (2016-12-02)
  Added two plunkers that each test _one simple component_ so you can write a component test plunker of your own: <live-example name="setup" plnkr="quickstart-specs">one</live-example> for the QuickStart seed's `AppComponent` and <live-example name="testing" plnkr="banner-specs">another</live-example> for the Testing guide's `BannerComponent`. 
  Linked to these plunkers in [Testing](testing.html#live-examples) and [Setup anatomy](setup-systemjs-anatomy) guides.

  ## Internationalization: pluralization and _select_ (2016-11-30)
  The [Internationalization (i18n)](../cookbook/i18n.html) guide explains how to handle pluralization and
  translation of alternative texts with `select`.
  The sample demonstrates these features too.

  ## Testing: karma file updates (2016-11-30)
  * `karma.config` + `karma-test-shim` can handle multiple spec source paths;
  see quickstart issue: [angular/quickstart#294](https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/294).
  * Displays Jasmine Runner output in the karma-launched browser.

  ## QuickStart Rewrite (2016-11-18)
  The QuickStart is completely rewritten so that it actually is quick.
  It references a minimal "Hello Angular" app running in Plunker.
  The new [Setup](setup.html) page tells you how to install a local development environment
  by downloading (or cloning) the QuickStart github repository.
  You are no longer asked to copy-and-paste code into setup files that were not explained anyway.

  ## Sync with Angular v.2.2.0 (2016-11-14)
  Docs and code samples updated and tested with Angular v.2.2.0.

  ## UPDATE: NgUpgrade Guide for the AOT friendly _upgrade/static_ module (2016-11-14)
  The updated [NgUpgrade Guide](upgrade.html) guide covers the 
  new AOT friendly `upgrade/static` module 
  released in v.2.2.0, which is the recommended
  facility for migrating from AngularJS to Angular.
  The documentation for the version prior to v.2.2.0 has been removed.

  ## ES6  described in "TypeScript to JavaScript" (2016-11-14)
  The updated [TypeScript to JavaScript](../cookbook/ts-to-js.html) cookbook 
  now explains how to write apps in ES6/7
  by translating the common idioms in the TypeScript documentation examples
  (and elsewhere on the web) to ES6/7 and ES5.

  ## Sync with Angular v.2.1.1 (2016-10-21)
  Docs and code samples updated and tested with Angular v.2.1.1.

  ## npm _@types_ packages replace _typings_ (2016-10-20)
  Documentation samples now get TypeScript type information for 3rd party libraries
  from npm `@types` packages rather than with the _typings_ tooling.
  The `typings.json` file is gone.

  The [AngularJS Upgrade](upgrade.html) guide reflects this change.
  The `package.json` installs `@types/angular` and several `@types/angular-...`
  packages in support of upgrade; these are not needed for pure Angular development.

  ## "Template Syntax" explains two-way data binding syntax (2016-10-20)
  Demonstrates how to two-way data bind to a custom Angular component and
  re-explains `[(ngModel)]` in terms of the basic `[()]` syntax.

  ## BREAKING CHANGE: `in-memory-web-api` (v.0.1.11) delivered as esm umd (2016-10-19)
  This change supports ES6 developers and aligns better with typical Angular libraries.
  It does not affect the module's API but it does affect how you load and import it.
  See the <a href="https://github.com/angular/in-memory-web-api/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0113-2016-10-20" target="_blank">change note</a>
  in the `in-memory-web-api` repo.

  ## "Router" _preload_ syntax and _:enter_/_:leave_ animations (2016-10-19)
  The router can lazily _preload_ modules _after_ the app starts and
  _before_ the user navigates to them for improved perceived performance.
  
  New `:enter` and `:leave` aliases make animation more natural. 

  ## Sync with Angular v.2.1.0 (2016-10-12)
  Docs and code samples updated and tested with Angular v.2.1.0.

  ## NEW "Ahead of time (AOT) Compilation" cookbook (2016-10-11)
  The NEW [Ahead of time (AOT) Compilation](../cookbook/aot-compiler.html) cookbook
  explains what AOT compilation is and why you'd want it.
  It demonstrates the basics with a QuickStart app
  followed by the more advanced considerations of compiling and bundling the Tour of Heroes.

  ## Sync with Angular v.2.0.2 (2016-10-6)
  Docs and code samples updated and tested with Angular v.2.0.2.

  ## "Routing and Navigation" guide with the _Router Module_ (2016-10-5)
  The [Routing and Navigation](router.html) guide now locates route configuration
  in a _Routing Module_. 
  The _Routing Module_ replaces the previous _routing object_ involving the `ModuleWithProviders`.

  All guided samples with routing use the _Routing Module_ and prose content has been updated,
  most conspicuously in the 
  [NgModule](ngmodule.html) guide and [NgModule FAQ](../cookbook/ngmodule-faq.html) cookbook.

  ## New "Internationalization" Cookbook (2016-09-30)

  Added a new [Internationalization (i18n)](../cookbook/i18n.html) cookbook that shows how
  to use Angular "i18n" facilities to translate template text into multiple languages.

  ## "angular-in-memory-web-api" package rename (2016-09-27)

  Many samples use the `angular-in-memory-web-api` to simulate a remote server.
  This library is also useful to you during early development before you have a server to talk to.

  The package name was changed from "angular2-in-memory-web-api" which is still frozen-in-time on npm.
  The new "angular-in-memory-web-api" has new features. 
  <a href="https://github.com/angular/in-memory-web-api/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">Read about them on github</a>.

  ## "Style Guide" with _NgModules_ (2016-09-27)

  [StyleGuide](style-guide.html) explains recommended conventions for Angular modules (NgModule).
  Barrels now are far less useful and have been removed from the style guide;
  they remain valuable but are not a matter of Angular style.
  Also relaxed the rule that discouraged use of the `@Component.host` property.

  ## _moduleId: module.id_ everywhere (2016-09-25)

  Sample components that get their templates or styles with `templateUrl` or `styleUrls`
  have been converted to _module-relative_ URLs.
  Added the `moduleId: module.id` property-and-value to their `@Component` metadata.
  
  This change is a requirement for compilation with AOT compiler when the app loads
  modules with SystemJS as the samples currently do.

  ## "Lifecycle Hooks" guide simplified (2016-09-24)

  The [Lifecycle Hooks](lifecycle-hooks.html) guide is shorter, simpler, and 
  draws more attention to the order in which Angular calls the hooks.
