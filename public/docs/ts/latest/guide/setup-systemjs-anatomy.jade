  The documentation [setup](setup.html) procedures install a _lot_ of files,
  Most of them can be safely ignored.

  Application files _inside the_ **`app/`** and **`e2e/`** folders matter most to developers.
  
  Files _outside_ those folders condition the development environment.
  They rarely change and you may never view or modify them.
  If you do, this page can help you understand their purpose.
