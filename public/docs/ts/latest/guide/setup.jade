  ## Setup a local development environment
  The <live-example name=quickstart>QuickStart live-coding</live-example> example is an Angular _playground_.
  It's not where you'd develop a real application. 
  You [should develop locally](#why-locally "Why develop locally") on your own machine ... and that's also how we think you should learn Angular.

  Setting up a new project on your machine is quick and easy with the **QuickStart seed**,
  maintained [on github](https://github.com/angular/quickstart "Install the github QuickStart repo"). 

  Make sure you have [node and npm installed](#install-node "What if you don't have node?").
  Then ...
  1. Create a project folder (you can call it <span ngio-ex>quickstart</span> and rename it later).
  1. [Clone](#clone "Clone it from github") or [download](#download  "download it from github") the **QuickStart seed** into your project folder.
  1. [Install the _npm_ packages](#install-node "What if you don't have node?").
  1. Run `npm start` to launch the sample application.

  ### Clone

  Perform the _clone-to-launch_ steps with these terminal commands.

code-example(language="sh" class="code-shell").
  git clone https://github.com/angular/quickstart.git quickstart
  cd quickstart
  npm install
  npm start

a#download

  ### Download
  <a href="https://github.com/angular/quickstart/archive/master.zip" title="Download the QuickStart seed repository">Download the QuickStart seed</a>
  and unzip it into your project folder. Then perform the remaining steps with these terminal commands.

code-example(language="sh" class="code-shell").
  cd quickstart
  npm install
  npm start

  ## What's in the QuickStart seed?

  The **QuickStart seed** contains the same application as the QuickStart playground
  and even has <live-example>its own _playground_</live-example> 
  that accomodates development of richer examples in a live coding environment.
  
  But it's true purpose is to provide a solid foundation for _local_ development.
  Consequently, there are _many more files_ in the project folder on your machine, 
  most of which you can [learn about later](setup-systemjs-anatomy.html "Setup Anatomy").
  
  Focus on the following three TypeScript (`.ts`) files in the **`/app`** folder.

.filetree
  .file app
  .children
    .file app.component.ts
    .file app.module.ts
    .file main.ts

+makeTabs(`
    setup/ts/app/app.component.ts,
    setup/ts/app/app.module.ts,
    setup/ts/app/main.ts
  `, '', `
    app/app.component.ts,
    app/app.module.ts,
    app/main.ts
  `)(format='.')
:marked
  All guides and cookbooks have _at least these three files_. Each file has a distinct purpose and evolves independently as the application grows.

        Defines the same `AppComponent` as the one in the QuickStart playground.
        It is the **root** component of what will become a tree of nested components
        as the application evolves. 
  tr
    td <code>app.module.ts</code>
    td
      :marked
        Defines `AppModule`, the [root module](appmodule.html "AppModule: the root module") that tells Angular how to assemble the application.
        Right now it declares only the `AppComponent`. 
        Soon there will be more components to declare. 
  tr
    td <code>main.ts</code>
    td
      :marked
        Compiles the application with the [JiT compiler](../glossary.html#jit)
        and [bootstraps](appmodule.html#main "bootstrap the application") the application to run in the browser.
        That's a reasonable choice for the development of most projects and
        it's the only viable choice for a sample running in a _live-coding_ environment like Plunker.
        You'll learn about alternative compiling and deployment options later in the documentation.

    ### Next Step

    If you're new to Angular, we recommend staying on the [learning path](learning-angular.html).

  ## Appendix: _node_ and _npm_

    Node.js and npm are essential to modern web development with Angular and other platforms.
    Node powers client development and build tools.
    The _npm_ package manager, itself a _node_ application, installs JavaScript libraries.
    
    <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
    Get them now</a> if they're not already installed on your machine.
 
    **Verify that you are running node `v4.x.x` or higher and npm `3.x.x` or higher**
    by running the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
    Older versions produce errors.

    We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of node and npm. 
    You may need [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) if you already have projects running on your machine that 
    use other versions of node and npm.

  ## Appendix: Why develop locally

  <live-example>Live coding</live-example> in the browser is a great way to explore Angular.

  Links on almost every documentation page open completed samples in the browser.
  You can play with the sample code, share your changes with friends, and download and run the code on your own machine.

  The [QuickStart](../quickstart.html "Angular QuickStart Playground") shows just the `AppComponent` file.
  It creates the equivalent of `app.module.ts` and `main.ts` internally _for the playground only_.
  so the reader can discover Angular without distraction.
  The other samples are based on the QuickStart seed. 

  As much fun as this is ...
  * you can't ship your app in plunker
  * you aren't always online when writing code
  * transpiling TypeScript in the browser is slow
  * the type support, refactoring, and code completion only work in your local IDE

  Use the <live-example><i>live coding</i></live-example> environment as a _playground_, 
  a place to try the documentation samples and experiment on your own.
  It's the perfect place to reproduce a bug when you want to
  <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/new" target="_blank" title="File a documentation issue">file a documentation issue</a> or
  <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/new" target="_blank" title="File an Angular issue">file an issue with Angular itself</a>.
 
  For real development, we strongly recommend [developing locally](#develop-locally).
