  Angular 2 has a vocabulary of its own.
  Most Angular 2 terms are everyday English words
  with a specific meaning within the Angular system.

  We have gathered here the most prominent terms
  and a few less familiar ones that have unusual or
  unexpected definitions.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Annotation
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    In practice a synonym for [Decoration](#decoration).

 :marked
  ## Attribute Directive
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    A category of [Directive](#directive) that can listen to and modify the behavior of
    other HTML elements, attributes, properties, and components. They are usually represented
    as HTML attributes, hence the name.

    The `ng-class` directive for adding and removing CSS class names is a good example of
    an Attribute Directive.

  ## Binding
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Almost always refers to [Data Binding](#data-binding) and the act of
    binding an HTML object property to a data object property.

    May refer to a [Dependency Injection](#dependency-injection) binding
    between a "token" or "key" and a dependency [provider](#provider).
    This more rare usage should be clear in context.

:marked
  ## Bootstrap
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    We launch an Angular application by "bootstrapping" it with the `bootstrap` method.
    The `bootstrap` method identifies an application's top level "root" [Component](#component)
    and optionally registers service [providers](#provider) with the
    [dependency injection system](#dependency-injection).

    One can bootstrap multiple apps in the same `index.html`, each with its own top level root.


.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Component
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    An Angular class responsible for exposing data
    to a [View](#view) and handling most of the viewâ€™s display
    and user-interaction logic.

    The Component is one of the most important building blocks in the Angular system.
    It is, in fact, an Angular [Directive](directive) with a companion [Template](#template).

    The  developer applies the `@Component` [decorator](decorator) to
    the component class, thereby attaching to the class the essential component metadata
    that Angular needs to create a component instance and render it with its template
    as a view.

    Those familiar with "MVC" and "MVVM" patterns will recognize
    the Component in the role of "Controller" or "View Model".

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Data Binding
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Applications display data values to a user and respond to user
    actions (clicks, touches, keystrokes).

    We could push application data values into HTML, attach
    event listeners, pull changed values from the screen, and
    update application data values ... all by hand.

    Or we could declare the relationship between an HTML widget
    and an application data source ... and let a data binding
    framework handle the details.

    Data Binding is that second approach. Angular has a rich
    data binding framework with a variety of data binding
    operations and supporting declaration syntax.

     The many forms of binding include:
     * [Interpolation](./template-syntax.html#interpolation)
     * [Property Binding](./template-syntax.html#property-binding)
     * [Event Binding](./template-syntax.html#event-binding)
     * [Attribute Binding](./template-syntax.html#attribute-binding)
     * [Class Binding](./template-syntax.html#class-binding)
     * [Style Binding](./template-syntax.html#style-binding)
     * [Two-way data binding with ng-model](./template-syntax.html#ng-model)

    Learn more about data binding in the
    [Template Syntax](./template-syntax.html#data-binding) chapter.

  ## Decorator | Decoration
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    A Decorator is a **function** that adds metadata to a class, its members (properties, methods) and function arguments.

    Decorators are a JavaScript language [feature](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators), implemented in TypeScript and proposed for ES2016 (AKA ES7).

    We apply a decorator by positioning it
    immediately above or to the left of the thing it decorates.

    Angular has its own set of decorators to help it interoperate with our application parts.
    Here is an example of a `@Component` decorator that identifies a
    class as an Angular [Component](#component) and an `@Input` decorator applied to a property
    of that component.
    The elided object argument to the `@Component` decorator would contain the pertinent component metadata.
    ```
    @Component({...})
    export class AppComponent {
      constructor(@Inject('SpecialFoo') public foo:Foo) {}
      @Input()
      name:string;
    }
    ```
    The scope of a decorator is limited to the language feature
    that it decorates. None of the decorations shown here will "leak" to other
    classes appearing below it in the file.

  .alert.is-important
    :marked
      Always include the parentheses `()` when applying a decorator.
      A decorator is a **function** that must be called when applied.

  ## Dependency Injection
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Dependency Injection is both a design pattern and a mechanism
    for creating and delivering parts of an application to other
    parts of an application that request them.

    Angular developers prefer to build applications by defining many simple parts
    that each do one thing well and then wire them together at runtime.

    These parts often rely on other parts. An Angular [Component](#component)
    part might rely on a service part to get data or perform a calculation. When a
    part "A" relies on another part "B", we say that "A" depends on "B" and
    that "B" is a dependency of "A".

    We can ask a "Dependency Injection System" to create "A"
    for us and handle all the dependencies.
    If "A" needs "B" and "B" needs "C", the system resolves that chain of dependencies
    and returns a fully prepared instance of "A".

    Angular provides and relies upon its own sophisticated
    [Dependency Injection](./dependency-injection.html) system
    to assemble and run applications by "injecting" application parts
    into other application parts where and when needed.

    At the core is an [`Injector`](#injector) that returns dependency values on request.
    The expression `injector.get(token)` returns the value associated with the given token.

    A token is an Angular type (`OpaqueToken`). We rarely deal with tokens directly; most
    methods accept a class name (`Foo`) or a string ("foo") and Angular converts it
    to a token. When we write `injector.get(Foo)`, the injector returns
    the value associated with the token for the `Foo` class, typically an instance of `Foo` itself.

    Angular makes similar requests internally during many of its operations
    as when it creates a [`Component`](#AppComponent) for display.

    The `Injector` maintains an internal map of tokens to dependency values.
    If the `Injector` can't find a value for a given token, it creates
    a new value using a `Provider` for that token.

    A [Provider](#provider) is a recipe for
    creating new instances of a dependency value associated with a particular token.

    An injector can only create a value for a given token if it has
    a `Provider` for that token in its internal provider registry.
    Registering providers is a critical preparatory step.

    Angular registers some of its own providers with every injector.
    We can register our own providers. Quite often the best time to register a `Provider`
    is when we [bootstrap](#bootstrap) the application.
    There are other opportunities to register as well.

    Learn more in the [Dependency Injection](./dependency-injection.html) chapter.

  ## Directive
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    An Angular class responsible for creating, re-shaping, and interacting with HTML elements
    in the browser DOM. Directives are Angular's most fundamental feature.

    A Directive is almost always associated with an HTML element or attribute.
    We often refer to such an element or attribute as the directive itself.
    When Angular finds a directive in an HTML template,
    it creates the matching directive class instance
    and gives that instance control over that portion of the browser DOM.

    Developers can invent custom HTML markup (e.g., `<my-directive>`) to
    associate with their custom directives. They add this custom markup to HTML templates
    as if they were writing native HTML. In this way, directives become extensions of
    HTML itself.

    Directives fall into one of three categories:

    1. [Components](#component) that combine application logic with an HTML template to
    render application [views]. Components are usually represented as HTML elements.
    They are the building blocks of an Angular application and the
    developer can expect to write a lot of them.

    1. [Attribute Directives](attribute-directive) that can listen to and modify the behavior of
    other HTML elements, attributes, properties, and components. They are usually represented
    as HTML attributes, hence the name.

    1. [Structural Directives](#structural-directive), a directive responsible for
    shaping or re-shaping HTML layout, typically by adding, removing, or manipulating
    elements and their children.

  ## ECMAScript
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    The [official JavaScript language specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript).

    The latest approved version of JavaScript is
    [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/)
    (AKA "ES2015" or "ES6") and many Angular 2 developers will write their applications
    either in this version of the language or a dialect that strives to be
    compatible with it such as [TypeScript](#typesScript).

    Most modern browsers today only support the prior "ECMAScript 5" (AKA ES5) standard.
    Applications written in ES2015 or one of its dialects must be "[transpiled](transpile)"
    to ES5 JavaScript.

    Angular 2 developers may choose to write in ES5 directly.
:marked
  ## ECMAScript 2015
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    The lastest released version of JavaScript,
    [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/)
    (AKA "ES2015" or "ES6")
:marked
  ## ES2015
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Short hand for "[ECMAScript 2015](#ecmascript=2015)".
:marked
  ## ES6
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Short hand for "[ECMAScript 2015](#ecmascript=2015)".
:marked
  ## ES5
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Short hand for "ECMAScript 5", the version of JavaScript run by most modern browsers.

  ## Injector
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    An object in the Angular [dependency injection system](#dependency-injection)
    that can find a named "dependency" in its cache or create such a thing
    with a registered [provider](#provider).

:marked
  ## Input
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    A directive property that can be the ***target*** of a
    [Property Binding](./template-syntax.html#property-binding).
    Data values flow *into* this property from the data source identified
    in the template expression to the right of the equal sign.

    See the [Template Syntax](./template-syntax.html#inputs-outputs) chapter.

:marked
  ## Interpolation
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    A form of [Property Data Binding](#data-binding) in which a
    [template expression](#template-expression) between double-curly braces
    renders as text.  That text may be concatenated with neighboring text
    before it is assigned to an element property
    or displayed between element tags as in this example.

  code-example(language="html" escape="html").
    <label>My current hero is {{hero.name}}</label>

  :marked

    [Template Syntax](./template-syntax.html#interpolation) chapter.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Output
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    A directive property that can be the ***target*** of an
    [Event Binding](./template-syntax.html#property-binding).
    Events stream *out* of this property to the receiver identified
    in the template expression to the right of the equal sign.

    See the [Template Syntax](./template-syntax.html#inputs-outputs) chapter.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Pipe
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    An Angular pipe is a function that transforms input values to output values for
    display in a [view](#view). We use the `@Pipe` [decorator](decorator)
    to associate the pipe function with a name. We then can use that
    name in our HTML to declaratively transform values on screen.

    Here's an example that uses the built-in `currency` pipe to display
    a numeric value in the local currency.

  code-example(language="html" escape="html").
    <label>Price: </label>{{product.price | currency}}
  :marked
    Learn more in the chapter on [pipes](./pipes.html) .

:marked
  ## Provider
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    A Provider creates a new instance of a dependency for the Dependency Injection system.
    It relates a lookup token to code - sometimes called a "recipe" - that can create a dependency value.

    For example, `new Provider(Foo, {useClass: Foo})` creates a `Provider`
    that relates the `Foo` token to a function that creates a new instance of the `Foo` class.

    There are other ways to create tokens and recipes.
    See [Dependency Injection](#dependency-injection) chapter to learn more.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Router
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Most applications consist of many screens or [views](#view).
    The user navigates among them by clicking links and buttons
    and taking other similar actions that cause the application to
    replace one view with another.

    The [Angular router](./router.html) is a richly featured mechanism for configuring
    and managing the entire navigation process including the creation and destruction
    of views.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Structural Directive
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    A category of [Directive](#directive) that can
    shape or re-shape HTML layout, typically by adding, removing, or manipulating
    elements and their children.

    The `ng-if` "conditional element" directive and the `ng-for` "repeater" directive are
    good examples in this category.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Template
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    A template is a chunk of HTML that Angular uses to render a [view](#view) with
    the support and continuing guidance of an Angular [Directive](#directive),
    most notably a [Component](#component).

    We write templates in a special [Template Syntax](./template-syntax.html).

:marked
  ## Template Expression
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    An expression in a JavaScript-like syntax that Angular evaluates within
    a [data binding](#data-binding).  Learn how to write template expressions
    in the [Template Syntax](./template-syntax.html#template-expressions) chapter.

:marked
  ## Transpile
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    The process of transforming code written in one form of JavaScript
    (e.g., TypeScript) into another form of JavaScript  (e.g., [ES5](#es5)).

 :marked
  ## TypeScript
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    A version of JavaScript that supports most [ECMAScript 2015](#ecmascript=2015)
    language features and many features that may arrive in future versions
    of JavaScript such as [Decorators](#decorator).

    TypeScript is also noteable for its optional typing system which gives
    us compile-time type-checking and strong tooling support (e.g. "intellisense",
    code completion, refactoring, and intelligent search). Many code editors
    and IDEs support TypeScript either natively or with plugins.

    TypeScript is the preferred language for Angular 2 development although
    we are welcome to write in other JavaScript dialects such as [ES5](#es5).

    Angular 2 itself is written in TypeScript.

    Learn more about TypeScript on its [website](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## View
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    A view is a portion of the screen that displays information and responds
    to user actions such as clicks, mouse moves, and keystrokes.

    Angular renders a view under the control of one or more [Directives](#directive),
    especially  [Component](#component) directives and their companion [Templates](#template).
    The Component plays such a prominent role that we often
    find it convenient to refer to a component as a view.

    Views often contain other views and any view might be loaded and unloaded
    dynamically as the user navigates through the application, typically
    under the control of a [router](#rounter).

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Zone
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Zones are a mechanism for encapsulating and intercepting
    a JavaScript application's asynchronous activity.

    The browser DOM and JavaScript have a limited number
    of asynchronous activities, activities such as DOM events (e.g., clicks),
    [promises](#promise), and
    [XHR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)
    calls to remote servers.

    Zones intercept all of these activities and give a "zone client" the opportunity
    to take action before and after the asynch activity completes.

    Angular runs our application in a zone where it can respond to
    asynchronous events by checking for data changes and updating
    the information it displays via [data binding](#data-binding).
