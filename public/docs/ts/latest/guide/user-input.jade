  User actions such as clicking a link, pushing a button, and entering
  text raise DOM events.
  This page explains how to bind to those events using the Angular
  event binding syntax.

  ## Binding to user input events

  You can use [Angular event bindings](./template-syntax.html#event-binding)
  to respond to any [DOM event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).
  Many DOM events are triggered by user input. Binding to these events provides a way to
  get input from the user.

  To bind to a DOM event, surround the DOM event name in parentheses and assign a quoted
  [template statement](./template-syntax.html#template-statements) to it.

  The following example shows an event binding that implements a click handler:
+makeExample('user-input/ts/app/click-me.component.ts', 'click-me-button')(format=".", language="html")

<a id="click"></a>
:marked
  The `(click)` to the left of the equals sign identifies the button's click event as the **target of the binding**.
  The text in quotes to the right of the equals sign
  is the **template statement**, which responds
  to the click event by calling the component's `onClickMe` method.

  When writing a binding, be aware of a template statement's **execution context**.
  The identifiers in a template statement belong to a specific context object,
  usually the Angular component controlling the template.
  The example above shows a single line of HTML, but that HTML belongs to a larger component:

+makeExample('user-input/ts/app/click-me.component.ts', 'click-me-component', 'app/click-me.component.ts')(format=".")
:marked
  When the user clicks the button, Angular calls the `onClickMe` method from `ClickMeComponent`.

  ## Get user input from the $event object
  This section shows how to bind to the `keyup` event of an onscreen text box
  to get user input, then echo the input back to the screen.

  The following code listens to the `keyup` event and gets the user's input.
+makeExample('user-input/ts/app/keyup.components.ts', 'key-up-component-1-template', 'app/keyup.components.ts (template v.1)')(format=".")
:marked
  When a user presses and releases a key, the `keyup` event occurs, and Angular provides a corresponding
  DOM event object in the `$event` variable.
  The event object contains the user input data; that is, whatever key the user pressed.
  The code passes `$event` as a parameter to the component's `onKey()` method.
+makeExample('user-input/ts/app/keyup.components.ts', 'key-up-component-1-class-no-type', 'app/keyup.components.ts (class v.1)')(format=".")
:marked
 The expression `event.target.value` in the example code
  represents the character the user typed.
  The properties of an event object vary depending on the type of DOM event. For example,
  a mouse event includes different information than a textbox editing event. However, like all
  [standard DOM event objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event),
  the event object returned by `keyup` contains a property called
  `target`. The `target` property gives an
  [`HTMLInputElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement), which
  has a `value` property. For a keypress event, the `value` property contains the letter, number, or other character
  that the user pressed on the keyboard.

  The `onKey()` component method gets the user's keystroke
  from the event object, then adds it to the list of user data
  in the component's `values` property.
  Then the [interpolation](./template-syntax.html#interpolation)
  displays the accumulated user input from the `values` property, followed by a pipe character (|).

  Suppose the user enters the letters "abc", and then backspaces to remove them one by one.
  Here's what the UI displays:
code-example().
  a | ab | abc | ab | a | |

    This example casts the `$event` as an `any` type.
    In this way, the code is simplified, but strong typing is lost.

    In the following example, the method is rewritten to cast to HTML DOM objects:
  +makeExample('user-input/ts/app/keyup.components.ts', 'key-up-component-1-class', 'app/keyup.components.ts (class v.1 - strongly typed )')(format=".")
  :marked
    <br>Strong typing reveals a serious problem with passing a DOM event into the method:
    too much awareness of template details, and too little separation of concerns.

    The next section shows how to use template reference variables to address this problem.

  ## Get user input from a template reference variable
   As mentioned in the previous section, it is not ideal to pass an event variable into a method
  to get user input. But there's another way to get the user data: use Angular
  [**template reference variables**](./template-syntax.html#ref-vars).
  These variables grant direct access to an element.
  To declare a template reference variable, precede an identifier with a hash (or pound) character (#).

  The following example uses a template reference variable
  to implement a keystroke loopback in a simple template.
+makeExample('user-input/ts/app/loop-back.component.ts', 'loop-back-component', 'app/loop-back.component.ts')(format=".")
:marked
  The template reference variable named `box`, declared on the `<input>` element,
  refers to the `<input>` element itself.
  The code uses the `box` variable to get the input element's `value` and display it
  with interpolation between `<p>` tags.

  The template is completely self contained. It doesn't bind to the component,
  and the component does nothing.

  Type something in the input box, and watch the display update with each keystroke.

    img(src='/resources/images/devguide/user-input/keyup-loop-back-anim.gif' alt="loop back")
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    **This won't work at all unless you bind to an event**.

    Angular updates the bindings (and therefore the screen)
    only if the app does something in response to asynchronous events, such as keystrokes.
    This example code binds the `keyup` event
    to the number 0, the shortest template statement possible. The statement
    does nothing, but it satisfies Angular's requirement so that Angular will
    update the screen.
:marked
  It's easier to get to the textbox with the template reference
  variable than to go through the `$event` object. Here's a rewrite of the previous
  `keyup` example that uses a template reference variable to get the user's input.
+makeExample('user-input/ts/app/keyup.components.ts', 'key-up-component-2' ,'app/keyup.components.ts (v2)')(format=".")
:marked
  A nice aspect of this approach is that the component code gets clean data values from the view.
  It no longer requires knowledge of the `$event` and its structure.

<a id="key-event"></a>
.l-main-section

  ## Key event filtering (with `key.enter`)
  Sometimes only the Enter key matters, because it signals that the user has finished typing.
  But the `(keyup)` event handler hears *every keystroke.*
  One way to reduce the noise would be to examine every `$event.keyCode` and take action when the key is Enter.
  But there's an easier way: bind to Angular's `keyup.enter` pseudo-event. With this pseudo-event,
  Angular calls the event handler only when the user presses Enter.

  In this example, the data binding expression handles the event. It's a better practice
  to minimize JavaScript in HTML. Move this code to the component.
+makeExample('user-input/ts/app/keyup.components.ts', 'key-up-component-3' ,'app/keyup.components.ts (v3)')(format=".")
:marked
  Here's how it works.

    img(src='/resources/images/devguide/user-input/keyup3-anim.gif' alt="key up 3")

  ## On blur

  In the previous example, the current state of the input box
  is lost if the user mouses away and clicks elsewhere on the page
  without first pressing Enter.
  The component's `values` property is updated only when the user presses Enter.

  To fix this issue, listen to both the Enter key and the blur event.

+makeExample('user-input/ts/app/keyup.components.ts', 'key-up-component-4' ,'app/keyup.components.ts (v4)')(format=".")

  ## Put it all together
  The previous page showed how to [display data](./displaying-data.html).
  This page demonstrated event binding techniques.

  Now, put it all together in a micro-app
  that can display a list of heroes and add new heroes to the list.
  The user can add a hero by typing the hero's name in the input box and
  clicking **Add**.

figure.image-display
    img(src='/resources/images/devguide/user-input/little-tour-anim.gif' alt="Little Tour of Heroes")
:marked
  Below is the "Little Tour of Heroes"  component.

+makeExample('user-input/ts/app/little-tour.component.ts', 'little-tour', 'app/little-tour.component.ts')(format=".")
:marked
  ### Use template variables to refer to elements

  The `newHero` template variable refers to the `<input>` element.
  You can use `newHero` from any sibling or child of the `<input>` element.

  Getting the element from a template variable makes the button click handler
  simpler. Without the variable, the code would have to include a CSS selector
  to find the input element.

  ### Pass values, not elements

  We could have passed the `newHero` into the component's `addHero` method.

  But that would require `addHero` to pick its way through the `<input>` DOM element,
  something we learned to dislike in our first try at a [keyup component](#keyup1).

  Instead, we grab the input box *value* and pass *that* to `addHero`.
  The component knows nothing about HTML or the DOM, which is the way we like it.

  ### Keep template statements simple
  We bound `(blur)` to *two* JavaScript statements.

  We like the first one, which calls `addHero`.
  We do not like the second one, which assigns an empty string to the input box value.

  The second statement exists for a good reason. We have to clear the input box after adding the new hero to the list.
  The component has no way to do that itself because it has no access to the
  input box (our design choice).

  Although the example *works*, we are rightly wary of JavaScript in HTML.
  Template statements are powerful. We're supposed to use them responsibly.
  Complex JavaScript in HTML is irresponsible.

  Should we reconsider our reluctance to pass the input box into the component?

  There should be a better third way. And there is, as we'll see when we learn about `NgModel` in the [Forms](forms.html) chapter.

  ## Summary

  We've mastered the basic primitives for responding to user input and gestures.
  As powerful as these primitives are, they are a bit clumsy for handling
  large amounts of user input. We're operating down at the low level of events when
  we should be writing two-way bindings between data entry fields and model properties.

  Angular has a two-way binding called `NgModel`, which we'll learn about
  in the `Forms` chapter.
