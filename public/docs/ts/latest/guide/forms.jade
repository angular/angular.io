  Forms are the mainstay of business applications.
  You use forms to log in, submit a help request, place an order, book a flight,
  schedule a meeting, and perform countless other data-entry tasks.

  In developing a form, it's important to create a data-entry experience that guides the
  user efficiently and effectively through the workflow.

  Developing forms requires design skills (which are out of scope for this page), as well as framework support for
  *two-way data binding, change tracking, validation, and error handling*,
  which you'll learn about on this page.

  This page shows you how to build a simple form from scratch. Along the way you'll learn how to:

  * Build an Angular form with a component and template.
  * Use `ngModel` to create two-way data bindings for reading and writing input-control values.
  * Track state changes and the validity of form controls.
  * Provide visual feedback using special CSS classes that track the state of the controls.
  * Display validation errors to users and enable/disable form controls.
  * Share information across HTML elements using template reference variables.

  You can run the <live-example></live-example> in Plunker and download the code from there.

  ## Template-driven forms

  You can build forms by writing templates in the Angular [template syntax](./template-syntax.html) with
  the form-specific directives and techniques described in this page.

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    You can also use a reactive (or model-driven) approach to build forms. 
    However, this page focuses on template-driven forms.

:marked
  You can build almost any form with an Angular template&mdash;login forms, contact forms, and pretty much any business form.
  You can lay out the controls creatively, bind them to data, specify validation rules and display validation errors,
  conditionally enable or disable specific controls, trigger built-in visual feedback, and much more.

  Angular makes the process easy by handling many of the repetitive, boilerplate tasks you'd
  otherwise wrestle with yourself.

  You'll learn to build a template-driven form that looks like this:

figure.image-display
  img(src="/resources/images/devguide/forms/hero-form-1.png" width="400px" alt="Clean Form")

:marked
  The *Hero Employment Agency* uses this form to maintain personal information about heroes.
  Every hero needs a job. It's the company mission to match the right hero with the right crisis.

  Two of the three fields on this form are required. Required fields have a green bar on the left to make them easy to spot.

  If you delete the hero name, the form displays a validation error in an attention-grabbing style:

figure.image-display
  img(src="/resources/images/devguide/forms/hero-form-2.png" width="400px" alt="Invalid, Name Required")

:marked
  Note that the *Submit* button is disabled, and the "required" bar to the left of the input control changes from green to red.

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    You can customize the colors and location of the "required" bar with standard CSS.

:marked
  You'll build this form in small steps:

  1. Create the `Hero` model class.
  1. Create the component that controls the form.
  1. Create a template with the initial form layout.
  1. Bind data properties to each form control using the `ngModel` two-way data-binding syntax.
  1. Add a `name` attribute to each form-input control.
  1. Add custom CSS to provide visual feedback.
  1. Show and hide validation-error messages.
  1. Handle form submission with *ngSubmit*.
  1. Disable the form’s *Submit* button until the form is valid.

:marked
  ## Setup

  Follow the [setup](setup.html) instructions for creating a new project
  named angular-forms.

  ## Create the Hero model class

  As users enter form data, you'll capture their changes and update an instance of a model.
  You can't lay out the form until you know what the model looks like.

  A model can be as simple as a "property bag" that holds facts about a thing of application importance.
  That describes well the `Hero` class with its three required fields (`id`, `name`, `power`)
  and one optional field (`alterEgo`).

  In the `app` directory, create the following file with the given content:

+makeExample('src/app/hero.ts')

:marked
  It's an anemic model with few requirements and no behavior. Perfect for the demo.

  The TypeScript compiler generates a public field for each `public` constructor parameter and
  automatically assigns the parameter’s value to that field when you create heroes.

  The `alterEgo` is optional, so the constructor lets you omit it; note the question mark (?) in `alterEgo?`.

  You can create a new hero like this:

+makeExcerpt('src/app/hero-form.component.ts', 'SkyDog', '')

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Create a form component

  An Angular form has two parts: an HTML-based _template_ and a component _class_ 
  to handle data and user interactions programmatically.
  Begin with the class because it states, in brief, what the hero editor can do.

  Create the following file with the given content:

+makeExcerpt('src/app/hero-form.component.ts', 'v1')

:marked
  There’s nothing special about this component, nothing form-specific,
  nothing to distinguish it from any component you've written before.

  Understanding this component requires only the Angular concepts covered in previous pages.

  * The code imports the Angular core library and the `Hero` model you just created.
  * The `@Component` selector value of "hero-form" means you can drop this form in a parent template with a `<hero-form>` tag.
  * The `templateUrl` property points to a separate file for the template HTML.
  * You defined dummy data for `model` and `powers`, as befits a demo.
  
  Down the road, you can inject a data service to get and save real data
  or perhaps expose these properties as inputs and outputs
  (see [Input and output properties](./template-syntax.html#inputs-outputs) on the
  [Template Syntax](./template-syntax.html) page) for binding to a
  parent component. This is not a concern now and these future changes won't affect the form.

  * You added a `diagnostic` property to return a JSON representation of the model.
  It'll help you see what you're doing during development; you've left yourself a cleanup note to discard it later.

  ### Why the separate template file?

  Why don't you write the template inline in the component file as you often do elsewhere?

  There is no "right" answer for all occasions. Inline templates are useful when they are short.
  Most form templates aren't short. TypeScript and JavaScript files generally aren't the best place to
  write (or read) large stretches of HTML, and few editors help with files that have a mix of HTML and code.

  Form templates tend to be large, even when displaying a small number of fields,
  so it's usually best to put the HTML template in a separate file.
  You'll write that template file in a moment. First,
  revise the `app.module.ts` and `app.component.ts` to make use of the new `HeroFormComponent`.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Revise *app.module.ts*

  `app.module.ts` defines the application's root module. In it you identify the external modules you'll use in the application
  and declare the components that belong to this module, such as the `HeroFormComponent`.

  Because template-driven forms are in their own module, you need to add the `FormsModule` to the array of
  `imports` for the application module before you can use forms.

  Replace the contents of the "QuickStart" version with the following:
+makeExample('forms/ts/src/app/app.module.ts', null, 'src/app/app.module.ts')

:marked
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    There are three changes:

    1. You import `FormsModule` and the new `HeroFormComponent`.

    1. You add the `FormsModule` to the list of `imports` defined in the `ngModule` decorator. This gives the application
    access to all of the template-driven forms features, including `ngModel`.

    1. You add the `HeroFormComponent` to the list of `declarations` defined in the `ngModule` decorator. This makes
    the `HeroFormComponent` component visible throughout this module.

.alert.is-important
  :marked
    If a component, directive, or pipe belongs to a module in the `imports` array, ​_don't_​ re-declare it in the `declarations` array.
    If you wrote it and it should belong to this module, ​_do_​ declare it in the `declarations` array.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Revise *app.component.ts*

  `AppComponent` is the application's root component. It will host the new `HeroFormComponent`.

  Replace the contents of the "QuickStart" version with the following:

+makeExample('src/app/app.component.ts')

:marked
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    There are only two changes.
    The `template` is simply the new element tag identified by the component's `selector` property.
    This displays the hero form when the application component is loaded.
    You've also dropped the `name` field from the class body.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Create an initial HTML form template

  Create the template file with the following contents:

+makeExample('src/app/hero-form.component.html', 'start')

:marked
  The language is simply HTML5. You're presenting two of the `Hero` fields, `name` and `alterEgo`, and
  opening them up for user input in input boxes.

  The *Name* `<input>` control has the HTML5 `required` attribute;
  the *Alter Ego* `<input>` control does not because `alterEgo` is optional.

  You added a *Submit* button at the bottom with some classes on it for styling.

  *You're not using Angular yet*. There are no bindings or extra directives, just layout.

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    In template driven forms, if you've imported `FormsModule`, you don't have to do anything 
    to the `<form>` tag in order to make use of `FormsModule`. Continue on to see how this works.

:marked
  The `container`, `form-group`, `form-control`, and `btn` classes
  come from [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/). These classes are purely cosmetic.
  Bootstrap gives the form a little style.

.callout.is-important
  header Angular forms don't require a style library
  :marked
    Angular makes no use of the `container`, `form-group`, `form-control`, and `btn` classes or
    the styles of any external library. Angular apps can use any CSS library or none at all.

:marked
  To add the stylesheet, open `index.html` and add the following link to the `<head>`:

+makeExcerpt('src/index.html', 'bootstrap')

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Add powers with _*ngFor_

  The hero must choose one superpower from a fixed list of agency-approved powers.
  You maintain that list internally (in `HeroFormComponent`).

  You'll add a `select` to the
  form and bind the options to the `powers` list using `ngFor`,
  a technique seen previously in the [Displaying Data](./displaying-data.html) page.

  Add the following HTML *immediately below* the *Alter Ego* group:

+makeExcerpt('src/app/hero-form.component.html (powers)')

:marked
  This code repeats the `<option>` tag for each power in the list of powers.
  The `pow` template input variable is a different power in each iteration;
  you display its name using the interpolation syntax.

.l-main-section#ngModel
:marked
  ## Two-way data binding with _ngModel_

  Running the app right now would be disappointing.

figure.image-display
  img(src="/resources/images/devguide/forms/hero-form-3.png" width="400px" alt="Early form with no binding")
:marked
  You don't see hero data because you're not binding to the `Hero` yet.
  You know how to do that from earlier pages.
  [Displaying Data](./displaying-data.html) teaches property binding.
  [User Input](./user-input.html) shows how to listen for DOM events with an
  event binding and how to update a component property with the displayed value.

  Now you need to display, listen, and extract at the same time.

  You could use the techniques you already know, but
  instead you'll use the new `[(ngModel)]` syntax, which
  makes binding the form to the model easy.

  Find the `<input>` tag for *Name* and update it like this:

+makeExcerpt('src/app/hero-form.component.html (excerpt)', 'ngModelName-1')

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    You added a diagnostic interpolation after the input tag
    so you can see what you're doing.
    You left yourself a note to throw it away when you're done.

:marked
  Focus on the binding syntax: `[(ngModel)]="..."`.

  You need one more addition to display the data. Declare 
  a template variable for the form. Update the `<form>` tag with 
  `#heroForm="ngForm"` as follows:

+makeExcerpt('src/app/hero-form.component.html (excerpt)', 'template-variable')

:marked
  The variable `heroForm` is now a reference to the `NgForm` directive that governs the form as a whole.

.l-sub-section#ngForm
  :marked
    ### The _NgForm_ directive

    What `NgForm` directive?
    You didn't add an [NgForm](../api/forms/index/NgForm-directive.html) directive.

    Angular did. Angular automatically creates and attaches an `NgForm` directive to the `<form>` tag.

    The `NgForm` directive supplements the `form` element with additional features.
    It holds the controls you created for the elements with an `ngModel` directive
    and `name` attribute, and monitors their properties, including their validity.
    It also has its own `valid` property which is true only *if every contained
    control* is valid.

:marked
  If you ran the app now and started typing in the *Name* input box,
  adding and deleting characters, you'd see them appear and disappear
  from the interpolated text.
  At some point it might look like this:

figure.image-display
  img(src="/resources/images/devguide/forms/ng-model-in-action.png" width="400px" alt="ngModel in action")

:marked
  The diagnostic is evidence that values really are flowing from the input box to the model and
  back again.
  
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    That's *two-way data binding*.
    For more information, see
    [Two-way binding with NgModel](template-syntax.html#ngModel) on the
    the [Template Syntax](template-syntax.html) page.

:marked
  Notice that you also added a `name` attribute to the `<input>` tag and set it to "name",
  which makes sense for the hero's name. Any unique value will do, but using a descriptive name is helpful.
  Defining a `name` attribute is a requirement when using `[(ngModel)]` in combination with a form.

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Internally, Angular creates `FormControl` instances and
    registers them with an `NgForm` directive that Angular attached to the `<form>` tag.
    Each `FormControl` is registered under the name you assigned to the `name` attribute.
    Read more in the previous section, [The NgForm directive](#ngForm).

:marked
  Add similar `[(ngModel)]` bindings and `name` attributes to *Alter Ego* and *Hero Power*.
  You'll ditch the input box binding message
  and add a new binding (at the top) to the component's `diagnostic` property.
  Then you can confirm that two-way data binding works *for the entire hero model*.

  After revision, the core of the form should look like this:

+makeExcerpt('src/app/hero-form.component.html (excerpt)', 'ngModel-2')

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    * Each input element has an `id` property that is used by the `label` element's `for` attribute
    to match the label to its input control.
    * Each input element has a `name` property that is required by Angular forms to register the control with the form.

:marked
  If you run the app now and change every hero model property, the form might display like this:

figure.image-display
  img(src="/resources/images/devguide/forms/ng-model-in-action-2.png" width="400px" alt="ngModel in action")

:marked
  The diagnostic near the top of the form
  confirms that all of your changes are reflected in the model.

  *Delete* the `{{diagnostic}}` binding at the top as it has served its purpose.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Track control state and validity with _ngModel_

  Using `ngModel` in a form gives you more than just two-way data binding. It also tells
  you if the user touched the control, if the value changed, or if the value became invalid.

  The *NgModel* directive doesn't just track state; it updates the control with special Angular CSS classes that reflect the state.
  You can leverage those class names to change the appearance of the control.

table
  tr
    th State
    th Class if true
    th Class if false
  tr
    td The control has been visited.
    td <code>ng-touched</code>
    td <code>ng-untouched</code>
  tr
    td The control's value has changed.
    td <code>ng-dirty</code>
    td <code>ng-pristine</code>
  tr
    td The control's value is valid.
    td <code>ng-valid</code>
    td <code>ng-invalid</code>

:marked
  Temporarily add a [template reference variable](./template-syntax.html#ref-vars) named `spy`
  to the _Name_ `<input>` tag and use it to display the input's CSS classes.

+makeExcerpt('src/app/hero-form.component.html (excerpt)', 'ngModelName-2')

:marked
  Now run the app and look at the _Name_ input box.
  Follow these steps *precisely*:

  1. Look but don't touch.
  1. Click inside the name box, then click outside it.
  1. Add slashes to the end of the name.
  1. Erase the name.

  The actions and effects are as follows:

figure.image-display
  img(src="/resources/images/devguide/forms/control-state-transitions-anim.gif"  alt="Control State Transition")

:marked
  You should see the following transitions and class names:

figure.image-display
  img(src="/resources/images/devguide/forms/ng-control-class-changes.png" width="500px" alt="Control state transitions")

:marked
  The `ng-valid`/`ng-invalid` pair is the most interesting, because you want to send a
  strong visual signal when the values are invalid. You also want to mark required fields.
  To create such visual feedback, add definitions for the `ng-*` CSS classes.

  *Delete* the `#spy` template reference variable and the `TODO` as they have served their purpose.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Add custom CSS for visual feedback

  You can mark required fields and invalid data at the same time with a colored bar
  on the left of the input box:

figure.image-display
  img(src="/resources/images/devguide/forms/validity-required-indicator.png" width="400px" alt="Invalid Form")

:marked
  You achieve this effect by adding these class definitions to a new `forms.css` file
  that you add to the project as a sibling to `index.html`:

+makeExample('src/forms.css')

:marked
  Update the `<head>` of `index.html` to include this style sheet:

+makeExcerpt('src/index.html', 'styles')

:marked
  ## Show and hide validation error messages

  You can improve the form. The _Name_ input box is required and clearing it turns the bar red.
  That says something is wrong but the user doesn't know *what* is wrong or what to do about it.
  Leverage the control's state to reveal a helpful message.

  When the user deletes the name, the form should look like this:

figure.image-display
  img(src="/resources/images/devguide/forms/name-required-error.png" width="400px" alt="Name required")

:marked
  To achieve this effect, extend the `<input>` tag with the following:

  * A [template reference variable](./template-syntax.html#ref-vars).
  * The "*is required*" message in a nearby `<div>`, which you'll display only if the control is invalid.

  Here's an example of an error message added to the _name_ input box:

+makeExcerpt('src/app/hero-form.component.html (excerpt)', 'name-with-error-msg')

:marked
  You need a template reference variable to access the input box's Angular control from within the template.
  Here you created a variable called `name` and gave it the value "ngModel".

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Why "ngModel"?
    A directive's [exportAs](../api/core/index/Directive-decorator.html) property
    tells Angular how to link the reference variable to the directive.
    You set `name` to `ngModel` because the `ngModel` directive's `exportAs` property happens to be "ngModel".

:marked
  You control visibility of the name error message by binding properties of the `name`
  control to the message `<div>` element's `hidden` property.

+makeExcerpt('src/app/hero-form.component.html', 'hidden-error-msg', '')

:marked
  In this example, you hide the message when the control is valid or pristine;
  "pristine" means the user hasn't changed the value since it was displayed in this form.

  This user experience is the developer's choice. Some developers want the message to display at all times.
  If you ignore the `pristine` state, you would hide the message only when the value is valid.
  If you arrive in this component with a new (blank) hero or an invalid hero,
  you'll see the error message immediately, before you've done anything.

  Some developers want the message to display only when the user makes an invalid change.
  Hiding the message while the control is "pristine" achieves that goal.
  You'll see the significance of this choice when you [add a new hero](#new-hero) to the form.

  The hero *Alter Ego* is optional so you can leave that be.

  Hero *Power* selection is required.
  You can add the same kind of error handling to the `<select>` if you want,
  but it's not imperative because the selection box already constrains the
  power to valid values.

  Now you'll add a new hero in this form.
  Place a *New Hero* button at the bottom of the form and bind its click event to a `newHero` component method.

+makeExample('forms/ts/src/app/hero-form.component.html',
  'new-hero-button-no-reset',
  'src/app/hero-form.component.html (New Hero button)')

+makeExample('forms/ts/src/app/hero-form.component.ts',
  'new-hero',
  'src/app/hero-form.component.ts (New Hero method)')(format=".")

:marked
  Run the application again, click the *New Hero* button, and the form clears.
  The *required* bars to the left of the input box are red, indicating invalid `name` and `power` properties.
  That's understandable as these are required fields.
  The error messages are hidden because the form is pristine; you haven't changed anything yet.

  Enter a name and click *New Hero* again.
  The app displays a _Name is required_ error message.
  You don't want error messages when you create a new (empty) hero.
  Why are you getting one now?

  Inspecting the element in the browser tools reveals that the *name* input box is _no longer pristine_.
  The form remembers that you entered a name before clicking *New Hero*.
  Replacing the hero object *did not restore the pristine state* of the form controls.

  You have to clear all of the flags imperatively, which you can do
  by calling the form's `reset()` method after calling the `newHero()` method.

+makeExample('forms/ts/src/app/hero-form.component.html',
  'new-hero-button-form-reset',
  'src/app/hero-form.component.html (Reset the form)')

:marked
  Now clicking "New Hero" resets both the form and its control flags.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Submit the form with _ngSubmit_

  The user should be able to submit this form after filling it in.
  The *Submit* button at the bottom of the form
  does nothing on its own, but it will
  trigger a form submit because of its type (`type="submit"`).

  A "form submit" is useless at the moment.
  To make it useful, bind the form's `ngSubmit` event property
  to the hero form component's `onSubmit()` method:

+makeExcerpt('forms/ts/src/app/hero-form.component.html (ngSubmit)')

:marked
  You'd already defined a template reference variable, 
  `#heroForm`, and initialized it with the value "ngForm". 
  Now, use that variable to access the form with the Submit button.

:marked
  You'll bind the form's overall validity via
  the `heroForm` variable to the button's `disabled` property
  using an event binding. Here's the code:

+makeExcerpt('src/app/hero-form.component.html', 'submit-button', '')

:marked
  If you run the application now, you find that the button is enabled&mdash;although 
  it doesn't do anything useful yet.

  Now if you delete the Name, you violate the "required" rule, which
  is duly noted in the error message.
  The *Submit* button is also disabled.

  Not impressed?  Think about it for a moment. What would you have to do to
  wire the button's enable/disabled state to the form's validity without Angular's help?

  For you, it was as simple as this:

  1. Define a template reference variable on the (enhanced) form element.
  2. Refer to that variable in a button many lines away.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Toggle two form regions (extra credit)

  Submitting the form isn't terribly dramatic at the moment.

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    An unsurprising observation for a demo. To be honest,
    jazzing it up won't teach you anything new about forms.
    But this is an opportunity to exercise some of your newly won
    binding skills.
    If you aren't interested, skip to this page's conclusion.

:marked
  For a more strikingly visual effect,
  hide the data entry area and display something else.

  Wrap the form in a `<div>` and bind
  its `hidden` property to the `HeroFormComponent.submitted` property.

+makeExcerpt('src/app/hero-form.component.html (excerpt)', 'edit-div')

:marked
  The main form is visible from the start because the
  `submitted` property is false until you submit the form,
  as this fragment from the `HeroFormComponent` shows:

+makeExcerpt('src/app/hero-form.component.ts', 'submitted')

:marked
  When you click the *Submit* button, the `submitted` flag becomes true and the form disappears
  as planned.

  Now the app needs to show something else while the form is in the submitted state.
  Add the following HTML below the `<div>` wrapper you just wrote:

+makeExcerpt('src/app/hero-form.component.html (excerpt)', 'submitted')

:marked
  There's the hero again, displayed read-only with interpolation bindings.
  This `<div>` appears only while the component is in the submitted state.

  The HTML includes an *Edit* button whose click event is bound to an expression
  that clears the `submitted` flag.

  When you click the *Edit* button, this block disappears and the editable form reappears.

.l-main-section

  ## Conclusion

  The Angular form discussed in this page takes advantage of the following
  framework features to provide support for data modification, validation, and more:

  * An Angular HTML form template.
  * A form component class with a `@Component` decorator.
  * Handling form submission by binding to the `NgForm.ngSubmit` event property.
  * Template-reference variables such as `#heroForm` and `#name`.
  * `[(ngModel)]` syntax for two-way data binding.
  * The use of `name` attributes for validation and form-element change tracking.
  * The reference variable’s `valid` property on input controls to check if a control is valid and show/hide error messages.
  * Controlling the *Submit* button's enabled state by binding to `NgForm` validity.
  * Custom CSS classes that provide visual feedback to users about invalid controls.
