  This page describes the Angular documentation at a high level.
  If you're new to Angular, you may want to visit "[Learning Angular](learning-angular.html)" first.

  ## Themes

  The documentation is divided into major thematic sections, each
  a collection of pages devoted to that theme.

    td
      :marked
        Recipes for specific application challenges, mostly code snippets with a minimum of exposition.

:marked
  A few early pages are written as tutorials and are clearly marked as such.
  The rest of the pages highlight key points in code rather than explain each step necessary to build the sample.
  You can always get the full source through the #{_liveLink}s.

  ## Code samples

  Each page includes code snippets from a sample application that accompanies the page.
  You can reuse these snippets in your applications.

  Look for a link to a running version of that sample, often near the top of the page,
  such as this <live-example nodownload name="architecture"></live-example> from the [Architecture](architecture.html) page.
  <span if-docs="ts">
  The link launches a browser-based, code editor where you can inspect, modify, save, and download the code.
  </span>

  Alternatively, you can run the example locally, next to those `live-example` links you have a <a href="/resources/zips/architecture/architecture.zip">download link</a>.
  Just download, unzip, run `npm install` to install the dependencies and run it with `npm start`.

  ## Reference pages

  * The [Cheat Sheet](cheatsheet.html) lists Angular syntax for common scenarios.
  * The [Glossary](glossary.html) defines terms that Angular developers should know.
  <li if-docs="ts">The [Change Log](change-log.html) announces what's new and changed in the documentation.</li>
  * The [API Reference](../api/) is the authority on every public-facing member of the Angular libraries.
