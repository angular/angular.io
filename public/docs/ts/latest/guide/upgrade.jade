  Having an existing Angular 1 application doesn't mean that we can't
  begin enjoying everything Angular 2 has to offer. That's beause
  Angular 2 comes with built-in tools for migrating Angular 1 projects
  over to the Angular 2 platform.
  
  One of the keys to a successful upgrade is to do it incrementally,
  by running the two frameworks side by side in the same application,
  and porting Angular 1 components to Angular 2 one by one. This makes
  it possible to upgrade even large and complex applications without
  disrupting other work. The `upgrade` module in Angular 2 has
  been designed to make incremental upgrading seamless.

  In this chapter we will look at a complete example of preparing and
  upgrading an application using the `upgrade` module. The app we're going
  to work on is [Angular PhoneCat](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat)
  from [the original Angular 1 tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial),
  which is where many of us began our Angular adventures. Now we'll see how to
  bring that application to the brave new world of Angular 2.
  
  During the process we'll learn
  
  - How to prepare and align an Angular 1 application with Angular 2
  
  - How to use the SystemJS module loader and TypeScript with Angular 1
  
  - How to develop and test a hybrid Angular 1+2 application
  
  - How to migrate an application to Angular 2 one component at a time
  
  To follow along with the tutorial, clone the
  [angular-phonecat](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat) repository
  and apply the steps as we go

  This is actually a pretty good starting point. In particular, this organization
  follows the [Angular Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide),
  which is an important [preparation step](preparation.html) before a successful upgrade. 
  
  * Each controller, factory, and filter is in its own source file, as per the
    [Rule of 1](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#single-responsibility).
  * The `core`, `phoneDetail`, and `phoneList` modules are each in their
    own subdirectory. Those subdirectories contain the JavaScript code as well as
    the HTML templates that go with each particular feature. This is in line with the
    [Folders-by-Feature Structure](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y152)
    and [Modularity](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#modularity)
    rules.

  ## TypeScript And Module Loading
  
  Since we're going to be writing our Angular 2 code in TypeScript, it makes sense to
  bring in the TypeScript compiler even before we begin upgrading.
  
  In order to use TypeScript's ES2015 module system to `import` and `export` code, we're
  going to need a JavaScript module loader. Our application doesn't currently
  use one, and is just using plain old `<script>` tags and the global `window` scope
  instead. We'll replace this approach with the
  [SystemJS loader](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs).

.alert.is-helpful
  :marked
    Angular 2 itself doesn't require either TypeScript or SystemJS.
    There will soon be other editions of this guide that show how to
    do the upgrade using ES5.
    
:marked
  We will also start to gradually phase out the Bower package manager in favor
  of NPM. We'll install all new dependencies using NPM, and will eventually be
  able to remove Bower from the project.

  Let's begin by installing the SystemJS and TypeScript packages to the project:
  ```
  npm i systemjs --save
  npm i typescript --save-dev
  ```
  
  The Angular 1 framework doesn't come with built-in TypeScript type definitions.
  This means that if we want to have type checks for the calls we make to Angular 1
  APIs, we should install its type definitions separately.
  For that we'll use the [tsd TypeScript definition manager](http://definitelytyped.org/tsd/).
  Let's make sure we have it globally installed:
  ```
  npm i -g tsd
  ```
  
  We can then use tsd to install the type definitions for Angular 1 and the Jasmine
  unit test framework. This will add a `typings` directory to the project and install
  a number of `.d.ts` files under it:
  ```
  tsd install angular angular-route angular-resource angular-mocks jasmine
  ```
  
  In `index.html`, let's now enable SystemJS. Add a `<script>` tag that loads
  the SystemJS library and a second `<script>` tag that initializes it. These
  will *replace* the various `<script>` tags we had earlier for loading the
  application components:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/app/index.html', 'scripts', 'app/index.html')

:marked
  This configuration tells SystemJS that we have a module called `app.module` that
  resides in the `js` subdirectory (relative to the `index.html` page). We then load that
  module using `System.import`. This will load and execute the `app/app.module.js` file.

  We should also configure the TypeScript compiler so that it can understand our
  project. We'll add a `tsconfig.json` file to the project directory, just like we did
  in the [Quickstart](../quickstart.html). It instructs the TypeScript compiler how
  to interpret our source files.
  
+makeJson('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/tsconfig.1.json', null, 'tsconfig.json')

:marked
  We are telling the TypeScript compiler to turn our TypeScript files to ES5 code
  bundled into SystemJS modules. In other words, our compiler target is something
  SystemJS can load and all major browsers are able to run.
  
  Also add a `tsc` run script to `package.json`. We'll use it to start the TypeScript
  compiler:

+makeJson('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/package.1.json', {paths: 'scripts'}, 'package.json', {otl: /(\"tsc.*)/})

:marked
  We can now launch the TypeScript compiler from the command line. It will watch
  our `.ts` source files and compile them to JavaScript on the fly. Those compiled
  `.js` files are then loaded into the browser by SystemJS. This is a process we'll
  want to have continuously running in the background as we go along.
  ```
  npm run tsc
  ```
    
  The next thing we'll do is convert our JavaScript files to TypeScript and define
  their imports and exports. Each file should now explicitly export the things
  it wants to expose, and import the things it needs from other files. This is a
  departure from the previous approach which just relied on things being available
  on the global `window` scope.

  Since TypeScript is a superset of ECMAScript 2015, which in turn is a superset
  of ECMAScript 5, we can simply switch the file extensions from `.js` to `.ts`
  and define the imports and exports. We don't need to make other changes to
  our existing code. Instead we'll introduce type annotations and other new
  features gradually over time.
  
  Let's begin by adding references to the Angular 1.x `.d.ts` typing files to the
  main application file. Rename `app.module.js` to `app.module.ts` and add the following on top
  of the file:
    
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/app/js/app.module.ts', 'typings', 'app/js/app.module.ts')

:marked
  The TypeScript compiler will now know what we mean when we reference
  Angular 1 APIs. It should already at this point be able to compile the
  `app.module.ts` file successfully.
  
  Let's then go through the rest of our source files and convert them.
  We'll rename each one to a `.ts` file, and add the imports and exports it needs.
  
  Beginning from the checkmark filter, here are the converted contents:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/app/js/core/checkmark.filter.ts', null, 'app/js/core/checkmark.filter.ts')

:marked
  This file now has the filter factory function as the default export. Apart from 
  the export, there's one other major change we've applied to the file, which
  is that it does *not* contain the registration of the filter into an Angular
  module. We will do that later in the `core` module's main file. 
  
  Moving to the `Phone` factory file, it now has the factory function as the default
  export:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/app/js/core/phone.factory.ts', null, 'app/js/core/phone.factory.ts')

:marked
  The `core` module's main module file will now import both the checkmark filter
  and the Phone factory. This is where we actually register them into the Angular module.
  We then export the module itself as this file's default export:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/app/js/core/core.module.ts', null, 'app/js/core/core.module.ts')

:marked
  Notice that with this organization pattern, the files that hold the application
  components themselves - filters and factories - aren't concerned with the makeup
  of Angular modules. That's just something we previously *had* to do because there
  were no other good solutions. Now we use a separate file just for the purpose
  of forming the Angular module.
  
  Now switching to the phone detail module, we'll make similar changes here. In the
  controller file we export the controller function as the default export:

+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/app/js/phone_detail/phone_detail.controller.ts', null, 'app/js/phone_detail/phone_detail.controller.ts')

:marked
  In the main module file we import the controller and register it into the Angular
  module, which itself is then exported:

+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/app/js/phone_detail/phone_detail.module.ts', null, 'app/js/phone_detail/phone_detail.module.ts')

:marked
  Then we'll repeat the same steps once more for the phone list module.
  The controller file exports the controller function:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/app/js/phone_list/phone_list.controller.ts', null, 'app/js/phone_list/phone_list.controller.ts')

:marked
  And the main module file imports the controller and registers it:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/app/js/phone_list/phone_list.module.ts', null, 'app/js/phone_list/phone_list.module.ts')

:marked
  Finally, we can now pull everything together in `app.module.ts`. It here we'll
  import each of the three submodule files and register them as dependencies
  of the main application module:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/app/js/app.module.ts', 'pre-bootstrap', 'app/js/app.module.ts')

:marked
  Note that we don't have to repeat the submodule name strings here. Since the
  modules export themselves, we can just refer to the `name` attribute of each 
  of them.
  
  Before this converted version of the application will run, we need to change the
  way we're bootstrapping it. It is currently bootstrapped using the `ng-app` directive
  attached to the `<html>` element of the host page. This will no longer work because
  `ng-app` is processed when the page loads, and our application code will not
  be available at that point yet. It is loaded asynchronously by SystemJS instead.
  
  We should switch to a JavaScript-driven bootstrap instead. As it happens, this is
  also how Angular 2 apps are bootstrapped, so the switch brings us one step closer
  to Angular as well. So, remove the `ng-app` attribute from `index.html`, and add
  this at the end of `app.module.ts`:

+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/app/js/app.module.ts', 'bootstrap', 'app/js/app.module.ts')

:marked
  We now have a fully functional version of the application, all converted
  into TypeScript code and a modern module system! If you start the project HTTP
  server with `npm start`, you should see the fully functional application in
  your browser. On the other hand, if you were to try running the *test suite*,
  things wouldn't look quite that good yet. We also have to make our tests
  support our new module organization.
  
:marked
  ## Preparing Tests
  
  Our project has both E2E Protractor tests and some Karma unit tests in it.
  Both of those are going to need a bit of work.
  
  Of these two, E2E tests are a lot easier to convert. By definition, 
  E2E tests access our application from the *outside* by interacting with 
  the various UI elements the app puts on the screen. E2E tests aren't really that
  concerned with the internal structure of the application components. That
  also means that although we've modified our project quite a bit, the E2E
  test suite should keep passing just as it was before. We haven't changed
  how the app behaves from the user's point of view.
  
  What we *can* do is convert our E2E test code to TypeScript, like we've
  done with the production code. To do this, you can just rename the
  `scenarios.js` file to `scenarios.ts`. After that, you'll want to declare
  the global Protractor variables used in the file, so that the TypeScript
  compiler knows we're accessing them on purpose:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/test/e2e/scenarios.ts', 'declares', 'test/e2e/scenarios.ts')

:marked
  Once we add Angular 2 to the project, we'll be able to add more type safety
  to this file, because Angular 2 ships with the type definitions of the
  Protractor framework as well.
   
  That pretty much takes care of E2E tests for now. For unit tests we're going
  to do a bit more. What we'll do is convert our existing unit tests to TypeScript
  as well as have them use `import`s to load in the code they need. We'll also need
  to tweak our Karma configuration so that it'll let SystemJS load the application
  files.
  
  But first we should have some additional type definitions loaded, so that the TypeScript
  compiler can understand the Jasmine and ngMock APIs we're using in unit tests. 
  Add a file called `test_helper.ts` to the test directory and add a reference
  to the Jasmine and mock type definitions we already installed earlier:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/test/test_helper.ts', null, 'test/test_helper.ts')

:marked
  For Karma's SystemJS support we'll use a shim file that will tweak the way
  files get loaded, so that it happens through SystemJS:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/test/karma_test_shim.js', null, 'test/karma_test_shim.js')

.alert.is-important The shim is likely to be replaced by improved tooling, but is currently needed.

:marked
  We'll then update the Karma configuration file, so that it loads SystemJS and the
  shim file. We'll also change how the app and unit tests files themselves are loaded.
  We will *watch* them so that the test suite is triggered when changes occur, but we
  won't have Karma *include* them because that is now done by SystemJS and the shim.
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/test/karma.conf.1.js', 'files', 'test/karma.conf.js')

:marked
  Now we have the infrastructure in place and can convert the test files themselves.
  This mainly just consists for changing the file extensions of those files, and adding
  the necessary imports to them.
  
  In the checkmark filter spec, we'll import the core module file, so that it is
  available when we load the corresponding Angular module:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/test/unit/checkmark.filter.spec.ts', 'top', 'test/unit/checkmark.filter.spec.ts')

:marked
  We'll do the exact same thing for the phone factory spec:

+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/test/unit/phone.factory.spec.ts', 'top', 'test/unit/phone.factory.spec.ts')

:marked
  In the phone detail controller spec, on the other hand, we should import
  the phone detail module:

+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/test/unit/phone_detail.controller.spec.ts', 'top', 'test/unit/phone_detail.controller.spec.ts')

:marked
  Finally, the phone list controller spec should import the phone list
  module:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/test/unit/phone_list.controller.spec.ts', 'top', 'test/unit/phone_list.controller.spec.ts')

:marked
  There's one more issue we have in our controller tests, which is that TypeScript
  isn't happy about compiling them at the moment. This is because we're using
  the custom Jasmine matcher `toEqualData` in both of them. Because this is something
  we define ourselves, it isn't included in the Jasmine type definitions that we
  installed using `tsd`.
  
  We can add our own little type definition file for that extension, which extends
  the `jasmine.Matchers` interface and adds our custom matcher to it. This will
  satisfy the compiler and let us use our custom matcher while retaining the nice
  type safety features of TypeScript:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/typescript-conversion/test/jasmine_matchers.d.ts', null, 'test/jasmine_matchers.d.ts')

:marked
  And now we have a fully functional test suite for our TypeScript-enabled
  application as well.
  
:marked
  ## Enjoying The Benefits of TypeScript
  
  Now that we have TypeScript, we can start benefiting from some of its
  other features in addition to the imports and exports that we're already using.
  There's a lot of value the language can provide in Angular 1 applications.
  
  For one thing, TypeScript is a superset of ES2015. Any app that has previously
  been written in ES5 - like the PhoneCat example has - can with TypeScript
  start incorporating all of the JavaScript features that are new to ES2015.
  These include things like `let`s and `const`s, default function parameters,
  and destructuring assignments.
  
  Another thing we can do is start adding *type safety* to our code, by
  adding type annotations. For instance, we can annotate the checkmark
  filter so that it expects booleans as arguments and returns strings.
  This makes it clearer what the filter is supposed to do, and makes it
  possible for the TypeScript compiler to notify us when we're trying to
  use it with incompatible types.
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/classes/app/js/core/checkmark.filter.ts', null, 'app/js/core/checkmark.filter.ts', {otl: /(:\w+)/g})
  
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    The [Angular 1.x type definitions](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/angularjs)
    we installed from TSD are not officially maintained by the Angular team,
    but are quite comprehensive. Though we're not going to do it in this
    tutorial, it is possible to make an Angular 1.x application fully
    type-annotated with the help of these definitions.
    
    If this is something we wanted to do, it would be a good idea to enable 
    the `noImplicitAny` configuration option in `tsconfig.json`. This would
    cause the TypeScript compiler to display a warning when there's any code that
    does not yet have type annotations. We could use it as a guide to inform
    us about how close we are to having a fully annotated project.
  
:marked
  Another TypeScript feature we can make use of is *classes*. In particular, we
  can turn our controllers into classes. That way they'll be a step
  closer to becoming Angular 2 component classes, which will make our life
  easier once we do the upgrade.
  
  Angular 1 expects controllers to be constructor functions, and that's what
  ES2015/TypeScript classes really are, and that means we can just register a
  class as a controller and Angular 1 will happily use it. We also won't 
  need to make any changes to our test suite as the external behavior of the
  controllers will not change.
  
  Here's what our new class for the phone list controller looks like.
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/classes/app/js/phone_list/phone_list.controller.ts', null, 'app/js/phone_list/phone_list.controller.ts')

:marked
  What was previously done in the controller function is now done in the class
  constructor function. The class additionally declares three members: The 
  array of phones, the name of the current sort key, and the search query. These
  are all things we have already been attaching to the controller,
  but that weren't explicitly declared anywhere. The last one of these isn't actually
  used in the TypeScript code since it's only referred to in the template, but for
  the sake of clarity we want to define all the members our controller will have.

  In the Phone detail controller we'll have two members: One for the phone
  that the user is looking at and another for the URL of the currently displayed image.
  We can additionally introduce a TypeScript interface that explicitly defines
  what we expect the `$routeParams` object to contain when it is
  passed to the controller. This interface is not exported and is just used internally
  inside this module:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/classes/app/js/phone_detail/phone_detail.controller.ts', null, 'app/js/phone_detail/phone_detail.controller.ts')
  
:marked
  This makes our controller code look a lot more like Angular 2 already. We're
  all set to actually introduce Angular 2 into the project.
  
  If we had any Angular 1 services in the project, those would also be
  a good candidate for converting to classes, since like controllers,
  they're also constructor functions. But we only have the `Phone` factory
  in this project, and that's a bit special since it's an `ngResource`
  factory. So we won't be doing anything to it in the preparation stage,
  but will instead turn it directly into an Angular 2 service in the
  next section.

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Gradually Upgrading to Angular 2
  
  Having completed our preparation work, let's get going with the Angular 2
  upgrade itself. We'll do this incrementally with the help of the `upgrade` module 
  that comes with Angular 2. By the time we're done, we can remove Angular 1
  from the project completely, but the key is to do it piece by piece
  without breaking the application.
  
.alert.is-important The project also contains some animations, which we are not yet upgrading in this version of the guide. This will change in a later release.
  
:marked
  Let's install Angular 2 into the project. Add the Angular 2 dependencies
  to `package.json` as described in the package.json appendix of the
  [Quickstart](../quickstart.html).
  Then run:
  
  ```
  npm i
  ```
  
  We can then load Angular 2 into the application by adding some `<script>`
  tags to `index.html`. They should go before the `<script>` tag with the
  `System.config()` invocation:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/app/index.html', 'ng2')

:marked
  The first two scripts are for adding some ES6 features to older browsers
  that don't natively support them. The last three bring in Angular 2
  itself.
  
  While we're at it, let's also load the same files into unit tests by
  updating the Karma config:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/test/karma.conf.1.js', 'ng2', 'test/karma.conf.js', {otl: /(.*\.\.\/node\_modules\/angular2.*)/})

.alert.is-important
  :marked
    After installing Angular 2, the TypeScript compiler will complain
    about a clash in the global `$` variable: The jQuery typings used
    by the Angular 1 typings introduce one, and the Protractor typings
    used by Angular 2 introduce another. This will be resolved in a 
    later release. See [issue #5459](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/5459)
    for some workarounds.

:marked
  ## Bootstrapping Hybrid 1+2 Applications

  What we'll do next is bootstrap the application as a *hybrid application*
  that supports both Angular 1 and Angular 2 components. Once we've done that
  we can start converting the individual pieces to Angular 2.
  
  At this point we need to do add the Angular 2 type definitions
  into `app.ts`, so that the TypeScript compiler knows what we're talking about
  when we use Angular 2 APIs. Unlike with Angular 1, we don't need to install
  or refer to these type definitions in our source code, because Angular 2
  comes with them included. What we do need to do is set the TypeScript
  compiler's `moduleResolution` option to `node`, so that it knows to look
  for these definitions from the `angular2` NPM package.
  
+makeJson('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/tsconfig.1.json', null, 'tsconfig.json', {otl: /(\"moduleResolution.*)/})

:marked
  Angular 2 bundles the Jasmine type definitions we need in tests, which means
  that the Jasmine type definitions we installed with `tsd` are now redundant.
  We might as well remove them so that there's no confusion about which ones
  we're using.
  ```
  rm -r typings/jasmine
  ```
  Also remove the  reference to those type definitions from
  `test/test_helper.ts`.
  
  The same also goes for Protractor: Angular 2 comes with the types of the
  Protractor APIs, so it's safe to remove the `declare var` line from
  `scenarios.ts`.
  
:marked
  To boostrap a hybrid application, we first need to initialize an `UpgradeAdapter`.
  This is an object that comes with the `angular2/upgrade` module. It provides the
  glue that joins the two versions of the framework together. It can be used to
  
  * Upgrade Angular 1 directives to Angular 2 components
  * Downgrade Angular 2 components to Angular 1 directives
  * Upgrade Angular 1 factories, services, and providers to Angular 2 services
  * Downgrade Angular 2 services to Angular 1 factories
  * Bootstrap and manage hybrid Angular 1+2 applications
  
  Together these features allow us to very flexibly mix and match the two
  frameworks in our apps. This flexibility is great because there are many 
  different kinds of Angular code out there. Even within a single app,
  we may need different strategies to deal with different kinds of components.
  
  Let's import the `UpgradeAdapter` class into `app.module.ts`:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/app/js/app.module.ts', 'adapter-import', 'app/js/app.module.ts')

:marked
  We can then make an adapter by instantiating the class:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/app/js/core/upgrade_adapter.ts', 'adapter-init')

  Now we can use that adapter to bootstrap our application as a hybrid.
  Instead of calling `angular.bootstrap`, we must call
  `upgradeAdapter.bootstrap`, but the function arguments remain the same:
  They are still the element that will become the root of the application,
  and the names of the root Angular 1.x modules that we want to include:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/app/js/app.module.ts', 'bootstrap')
  
:marked
  We are now running both Angular 1 and 2 at the same time. That's pretty
  exciting! We're not running any actual Angular 2 components yet though,
  so let's do that next.
  
    
:marked
  ## Upgrading Services

  The first piece we'll port over to Angular 2 is the `Phone` factory, which
  resides in `app/js/core/phones.factory.ts` and makes it possible for controllers
  to load phone information from the server. Right now it's implemented with
  ngResource and we're using it for two things:
  
  * For loading the list of all phones into the phone list controller
  * For loading the details of a single phone into the phone detail controller.
  
  We can replace this implementation with an Angular 2 service class, while 
  keeping our controllers in Angular 1 land. In the new version we'll just use
  the the `Http` service from Angular 2 instead of ngResource.
  
  The `Http` service isn't included in the main Angular 2 bundle, so we need to 
  include it in `index.html` separately. As the service uses RxJS Observables,
  we also need to bring in the RxJS bundle:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/app/index.html', 'ng2-http')

:marked
  We'll also do the same in `karma.conf.js` so that `Http` will be available in
  unit tests:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/test/karma.conf.1.js', 'ng2-http')

:marked
  Before the `Http` service is available for injection, we still need to register
  it into our application's dependency injector. We should import the `HTTP_PROVIDERS`
  constant in `app.module.ts`:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/app/js/app.module.ts', 'http-import')

:marked
  In a regular Angular 2 application we would now pass `HTTP_PROVIDERS` into
  the application bootstrap function. But we can't do that in a hybrid
  application such as the one we're working on. That's because the `bootstrap`
  method of  `UpgradeAdapter` expects Angular 1 modules as dependencies,
  not Angular 2 providers.
  
  What we must do instead is register `HTTP_PROVIDERS` into the `UpgradeAdapter`
  separately. It has a method called `addProvider` for that purpose:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/app/js/app.module.ts', 'add-http-providers')

:marked
  Now we're ready to upgrade the Phones factory itself. We'll put the Angular 2
  implementation in a new file called `Phones.ts` in the core module. It will be a TypeScript
  class decorated as `@Injectable`:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/app/js/core/Phones.ts', 'class', 'app/js/core/Phones.ts')

:marked
  Note that with Angular 2 we're switching to a new file naming scheme, and
  won't be using the `feature.type.ts` naming convention anymore.
  
  The `@Injectable` decorator will attach some dependency injection metadata
  to the class, letting Angular 2 know about its dependencies. As described
  by our [Dependency Injection Guide](../guide/dependency-injection.html),
  this is a marker decorator we need to use for classes that have no other
  Angular 2 decorators but still need to have their dependencies injected. 
  
  In its constructor the class expects to get the `Http` service. It will
  be injected to it and it is stored as a private field. The service is then
  used in the two instance methods, one of which loads the list of all phones,
  and the other the details of a particular phone:

+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/app/js/core/Phones.ts', 'fullclass')

:marked
  The methods now return Observables of type `Phone` and `Phone[]`. This is
  a type we don't have yet, so let's add a simple interface for it:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/app/js/core/Phones.ts', 'phone-interface', 'app/js/core/Phones.ts')

:marked
  Here's the full, final code for the service:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/app/js/core/Phones.ts', 'full', 'app/js/core/Phones.ts')

:marked
  Notice that we're importing the `map` operator of the RxJS `Observable` separately.
  We need to do this for all RxJS operators that we want to use, since Angular 2
  does not load all of them by default.

  The new `Phones` service now has the same features that the original, ngResource based
  service did. You can remove the old `phones.factory.ts` file. Now we just
  need to register the new service into the application, so that our Angular 1
  controllers will be able to use it.
  
  `UpgradeAdapter` has a `downgradeNg2Provider` method for the purpose of making
  Angular 2 services available to Angular 1 code. The problem is that we don't have
  our `UpgradeAdapter` available in `core.module.ts` where the `Phones` service should
  be registered. We only have it in `app.module.ts`. There should only be one
  `UpgradeAdapter` in an application, so we need to find a way to share our
  instance between the two code modules.
  
  What we'll do is create a new module that instantiates `UpgradeAdapter`
  and exports the instance. We can then just pull it in wherever we need it,
  so that we're using the same object everywhere. Let's put this new file
  under `core`:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/app/js/core/upgrade_adapter.ts', 'full', 'app/js/core/upgrade_adapter.ts')

:marked
  In `app.module.ts` we should now just import this adapter instead of making a separate one:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/app/js/app.module.ts', 'adapter-state-import')

:marked
  Also remove the line from `app.module.ts` that is instantiating `UpgradeAdapter`. It's no
  longer needed since we import the instance from elsewhere.
  
  We'll then do the same in `core.module.ts` as well. Then we can register the `Phones` service into it.
  While doing that, we can remove the module's dependency to `ngResource`, which
  we're no longer using.
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/app/js/core/core.module.ts', null, 'app/js/core/core.module.ts')

:marked
  Note that we actually needed to do two registrations here:
  
  1. Register `Phones` as an **Angular 2 provider** with the `addProvider`
     method. That's the same method that we used earlier for `HTTP_PROVIDERS`.
  2. Register an **Angular 1 factory** called `phones`, which will be a *downgraded*
     version of the `Phones` service.
     
  At this point we can switch our two controllers to use the new service
  instead of the old one. We `$inject` it as the downgraded `phones` factory,
  but it's really an instance of the `Phones` class and we can annotate its type
  accordingly:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/app/js/phone_detail/phone_detail.controller.ts', null, 'app/js/phone_detail/phone_detail.controller.ts')

+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/app/js/phone_list/phone_list.controller.ts', null, 'app/js/phone_list/phone_list.controller.ts')

:marked
  What we have here are two Angular 1 controllers using an Angular 2 service!
  The controllers don't need to be aware of this, though the fact that the
  service returns Observables and not Promises is a bit of a giveaway.
  In any case, what we've achieved is a migration of a service to Angular 2
  without having to yet migrate the controllers that use it.
  
  To bring our test suite up to speed with the changes, we should first enable
  the Angular 2 test support library in our unit test suite. We first need to 
  add the angular `testing` bundle to list of files that Karma is loading:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/test/karma.conf.1.js', 'ng2-testing')

:marked
  Then we'll update the Karma test shim. It should load the Angular 2
  browser adapter before getting to the spec files:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/test/karma_test_shim.js', null, 'test/karma_test_shim.js')

.alert.is-important The shim is likely to be replaced by improved tooling, but is needed right now.

:marked
  Now, let's look at the tests for the service itself. What we used to have in 
  `phones_factory_spec.js` was a fairly simple test that simply checks if
  the factory exists and is available for injection. We can now do that same
  test in Angular 2. Rename `phones.factory.spec.ts` to `Phones.spec.ts` and
  set the contents as follows:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/test/unit/Phones.spec.ts', null, 'test/unit/Phones.spec.ts')

:marked
  Here we first load the `Phones` provider and then test that an instance of
  `Phones` can in fact be injected. We also need to load `HTTP_PROVIDERS` since
  it is a dependency of `Phones`.
  
  For the controller tests, we can first of all at this point get rid of the
  custom `toEqualData` custom matcher. It was added because `ngResource` attaches
  attributes to the data that we don't want to compare in tests. We're no longer
  using `ngResource`, so we can simply use the built-in `toEqual` for comparisons.
  This means we can remove the `test/jasmine_matchers.d.ts` file at this point.
  
  Now, in the phone detail controller we have been testing that the phone details
  with the id given in the route params are fetched over HTTP and put on the
  scope. We can continue doing that, but we'll need to change the structure of the
  test a bit. Instead of using the Angular 1 mock HTTP backend, we'll just mock out
  the `get` method of the `Phones` service, which is what the controller is now
  using to load what it needs. As the mocked value, we're returning an Observable
  that will emit a single value - the mock phone data:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/test/unit/phone_detail.controller.spec.ts', null, 'test/unit/phone_detail.controller.spec.ts')

.alert.is-important
  :marked
    We're doing a manual `Phones` instantiation because hybrid apps can't be
    bootstrapped for unit tests at the moment, which means that Angular 2
    dependencies can't be made available. This is likely to change.

:marked
  In the phone list controller we'll do something very similar: We mock out the `query`
  method of the `Phones` service, and check that the controller makes the resulting
  value available:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_initial/test/unit/phone_list.controller.spec.ts', null, 'test/unit/phone_list.controller.spec.ts')

:marked
  ## Upgrading Controllers to Components
  
  Next, let's upgrade our Angular 1 controllers to Angular 2 components. We'll
  do it one at a time, while still keeping the application in hybrid mode.
  As we make these conversions, we'll also be defining our first Angular 2 *pipes*.
  
  Let's look at the phone list controller first. Right now it is a TypeScript class,
  which is paired with an HTML template by the route configuration in `app.ts`.
  We'll be turning it into an Angular 2 component.
  
  Rename `phone_list.controller.ts` to `PhoneList.ts`. Then rename the controller class
  inside to just `PhoneList` and decorate it as a `@Component`:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/phone_list/PhoneList_without_pipes.ts', 'top', 'app/js/phone_list/PhoneList.ts')

:marked
  The `selector` attribute is a CSS selector that defines where on the page the component
  should go. It will match elements by the name of `pc-phone-list`. It is a good idea
  to always use application-specific prefixes in selectors so that they never clash with
  built-in ones, and here we're using `pc-`, which is short for "PhoneCat".
  
  The `templateUrl` defines the location of the component template. It points to our existing
  template file
  
  Both of these attributes are things that were defined *externally* for the controller,
  but for the component are things that it defines *itself*. This will affect how we use
  the component in the router.
  
:marked
  We now also need to convert the template of this component into Angular 2 syntax.
  In the search controls we need to use Angular 2 syntax for the two `ngModel`s
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/phone_list/phone_list_without_pipes.html', 'controls', 'app/js/phone_list/phone_list.html')

:marked
  In the list we need to replace the `ng-repeat` with an `*ngFor` and its
  `#var of iterable` syntax, as described in our
  [Template Syntax guide](../guide/template-syntax.html).
  
  For the images, we can replace `ng-src` with the standard `src`, but will use a
  property binding. Note that we're also adding a `name` CSS class for the phone name.
  This is something we'll need for our Protractor tests:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/phone_list/phone_list_without_pipes.html', 'list', 'app/js/phone_list/phone_list.html')

:marked
  In the module file we're going to plug this component into our application. Instead
  of registering a controller, we register a `pcPhoneList` directive.
  The directive is a downgraded version of our component, and the `UpgradeAdapter`
  handles the bridging between the two:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/phone_list/phone_list.module.ts', null, 'app/js/phone_list/phone_list.module.ts')

:marked
  The `<angular.IDirectiveFactory>` type annotation here is to let the TypeScript compiler
  know that the return value of the downgrade method call will be something that can be
  used as a directive factory.
  
  To complete the switch, we should change our route configuration in `app.module.ts`.
  Instead of using the controller and template, it can just instantiate our component.
  We can do that by using a simple template that uses the directive
  we just registered:

+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/app.module.ts', 'list-route')

:marked
  When the application runs, the Angular 1.x directive compiler will match
  the element in the template to the `pcPhoneList` directive, which is actually
  an Angular 2 component!
  
  The remaining issue with the phone list is the use of filters in its
  template: It is referring to the `filter` filter and the `orderBy` filter,
  and relying on them to filter and sort the phone list, respectively.
  These pipes do not exist in Angular 2, so we're going to need to do
  the filtering and sorting ourselves. Let's define a couple of pipes that
  get the job done.

.alert.is-helpful
  :marked
    If you want to learn more about how pipes in Angular 2
    work, we have [a whole guide on the subject](../guide/pipes.html)
    available!
    
:marked
  For filtering, we'll have a pipe called `PhoneFilterPipe`. It works like 
  the `filter` filter in Angular 1 in that it filters a collection of objects,
  matching properties within the objects. But, as opposed to `filter`,
  this pipe is specialized to filter `Phone` objects and we can use
  type annotations to make this explicit:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/phone_list/PhoneFilterPipe.ts', null, 'app/js/phone_list/PhoneFilterPipe.ts')

:marked
  Since we're adding new code, it's a good idea to add some unit tests for
  it too. Here are a few tests for `PhoneFilterPipe`:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/test/unit/PhoneFilterPipe.spec.ts', null, 'test/unit/PhoneFilterPipe.spec.ts')

:marked
  For sorting, we'll use a more generic pipe, just called `OrderBy`. It
  takes an array of objects, and a property to order the array by. It returns
  an array of the same type of thing it was given. In the implementation we
  copy the input array, sort the copy, and return it.
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/phone_list/OrderByPipe.ts', null, 'app/js/phone_list/OrderByPipe.ts')

:marked
  Here's a unit test for `OrderByPipe` as well:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/test/unit/OrderByPipe.spec.ts', null, 'test/unit/OrderByPipe.spec.ts')

:marked
  We can now integrate these new pipes with our component. Before the pipes
  are available there, we need to declare them in the `@Component` decorator.
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/phone_list/PhoneList.ts', 'top', 'app/js/phone_list/PhoneList.ts')

:marked
  In the template we need to use the `phoneFilter` pipe instead of `filter`.
  No changes are needed for the `orderBy`
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/phone_list/phone_list_without_async.html', 'list', 'app/js/phone_list/phone_list.html')

:marked
  Now that the phone list is an Angular 2 component, there's one more neat trick
  we can apply to make its code a little bit simpler. Earlier, as we upgraded
  the `Phones` service, we needed to add a `subscribe` callback to the list
  response, which populated the `phones` array on the component.
  With Angular 2, we can instead just put the Observable itself on the
  component, and can skip the subscription callback:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/phone_list/PhoneList.ts', 'full', 'app/js/phone_list/PhoneList.ts')

:marked
  This is made possible by the `async` pipe, which we can apply in the template.
  It knows how to turn an Observable to the (latest) value it has emitted:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/phone_list/phone_list.html', 'list', 'app/js/phone_list/phone_list.html')

:marked
  That takes care of the phone list. Here's the updated unit test file for
  that component to complete the migration:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/test/unit/PhoneList.spec.ts', null, 'test/unit/PhoneList.spec.ts')

:marked
  Before this test will run, we'll need to augment our Karma configuration
  so that component HTML templates are loaded properly. We didn't need them
  before when we were testing the controller in isolation, but our new test
  exercises the component as a whole, which includes the template.
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/test/karma.conf.1.js', 'html', 'test/karma.conf.js')

:marked
  Now we can start looking at our other controller, which is the one for
  the phone details. Rename `phone_detail.controller.ts` to `PhoneDetail.ts`, and set the
  contents as follows:
    
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/phone_detail/PhoneDetail_without_pipes.ts', null, 'app/js/phone_detail/PhoneDetail.ts')

:marked
  This is pretty similar to what we did with the phone list. The one new change
  here is the use of `@Inject` for the `$routeParams` dependency. It tells the
  Angular 2 injector what this dependency should map to. We have a dependency called
  `$routeParams` in the Angular 1 injector, where it is provided by the Angular 1 router.
  That is what we were already using when `PhoneDetails` was still an Angular 1 controller.
  The things is though, Angular 1 dependencies are not made automatically available to
  Angular 2 components, so if we were to run this now, it would not work.
  
  We explicitly need to tell the `UpgradeAdapter` to upgrade `$routeParams` so that
  it is available for injection in Angular 2. We can do it in `app.module.ts`:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/app.module.ts', 'upgrade-route-params', 'app/js/app.module.ts')

  
    
:marked
  We now also need to convert the template of this component into Angular 2 syntax.
  Here is the new template in its entirety:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/phone_detail/phone_detail.html', null, 'app/js/phone_detail/phone_detail.html')

:marked
  There are several notable changes here:
  
  * We've removed the `vm.` prefix from all expressions.
  * Just like we did in the phone list, we've replaced `ng-src` with property
    bindings for the standard `src`.
  * We're using the property binding syntax around `ng-class`. Though Angular 2
    does have a very similar `ngClass` as Angular 1 does, its value is not
    magically evaluated as an expression. In Angular 2 we always specify
    in the template when an attribute's value is a property expression, as opposed
    to a literal string.
  * We've replaced `ng-repeat`s with `*ngFor`s.
  * We've replaced `ng-click` with an event binding for the standard `click`.
  * In all references to `phone`, we're using the elvis operator `?.` for
    safe property navigation. We need it because when the component first loads,
    we don't have `phone` yet and the expressions will refer to a non-existing
    value. Unlike in Angular 1, Angular 2 expressions do not fail silently when
    we try to refer to properties on undefined objects. We need to be explicit
    about cases where this is expected.
    
:marked
  In the module file we'll now register a `pcPhoneDetail` directive instead of a
  controller. The directive is a downgraded version of the `PhoneDetail` component.
    
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/phone_detail/phone_detail.module.ts', null, 'app/js/phone_detail/phone_detail.module.ts')

:marked
  In the router configuration in `app.module.ts`, we'll switch the details route to
  instantiate a component as well:

+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/app.module.ts', 'detail-route')

:marked
  There's one additional step we need to take, which is to upgrade the
  `checkmark` filter that the template is using. We need an Angular 2
  pipe instead of an Angular 1 filter.
  
  While there is no upgrade method in the upgrade adapter for filters, we
  can just transform the filter function into a class that fulfills
  the contract for Angular 2 Pipes. The implementation is the same as before.
  It just comes in a different kind of package. While changing it, also
  rename the file to `CheckmarkPipe.ts`:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/core/CheckmarkPipe.ts', null, 'app/js/core/CheckmarkPipe.ts')

:marked
  As we apply this change, we should also remove the registration of the filter
  from the core module file. The module's content becomes:

+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/core/core.module.ts', null, 'app/js/core/core.module.ts')

:marked
  The unit test file for the filter also now becomes the unit test filter
  for the pipe. While we're still testing the same thing, we need to change
  how we set things up:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/test/unit/CheckmarkPipe.spec.ts', null, 'test/unit/CheckmarkPipe.spec.ts')

:marked
  In the component we should now import and declare our newly created pipe:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/app/js/phone_detail/PhoneDetail.ts', 'top', 'app/js/phone_detail/PhoneDetail.ts')

:marked
  With the phone detail component now migrated as well, we can go and migrate
  its unit tests too.
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_components/test/unit/PhoneDetail.spec.ts', null, 'test/unit/PhoneDetail.spec.ts')

:marked
  As we discussed earlier, Protractor tests should largely remain functional
  as we are making changes, since we're not really changing the user-visible
  behavior of the application. Now that we've migrated some components and
  their templates, however, there are a few changes we need to make. Apply
  the following replacements to `scenarios.ts`:

  ## Switching To The Angular 2 Router And Bootstrap

  At this point we've replaced all our Angular 1 application components with
  their Angular 2 counterparts. The application is still bootstrapped as a hybrid,
  but there isn't really any need for that anymore, and we can begin to 
  pull out the last remnants of Angular 1.
  
  There are just two more things to do: We need to switch the router to
  the Angular 2 one, and then bootstrap the app as a pure Angular 2 app.
  
  Let's do the routing part first. Angular 2 comes with a shiny new router,
  but it isn't included by default. Just like we did with `Http`, we need to
  include it in `index.html` before the `System.config()` script first:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_final/app/index.html', 'ng2-router', 'app/index.html')

:marked
  In the main app module we need to import a few things from the router module:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_final/app/js/app.ts', 'router-import', 'app/js/app.module.ts')

:marked
  Angular 2 applications all come with a *root component*, which, among other
  things, is where we should plug in the router. We don't yet have such a root
  component, because our app is still managed as an Angular 1 app.
  Let's change this now and add an `AppComponent` class, which replaces the
  `configure` function in `app.module.ts`:

+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_final/app/js/app.ts', 'appcomponent')

:marked
  This is a component that plugs in to an `<pc-app>` element on the page,
  and has a simple template that only includes the router outlet component
  of the Angular router. This means that the component just renders the contents
  of the current route and nothing else. The `@RouteConfig` decorator defines
  the Angular 2 counterparts of our two routes. They refer directly to the
  two components.
  
  We should put this `<pc-app>` element in the HTML so that the root component
  has something to attach to. It replaces the old Angular 1 `ng-view` directive:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_final/app/index.html', 'body', 'app/index.html')

  In the `PhoneDetail` component we now need to change how the phone id parameter
  is received. There will be no more `$routeParams` injection available, because
  that comes from the Angular 1 router. Instead, what we have is a `RouteParams`
  object provided by the Angular 2 router. We use it to obtain the `phoneId` from
  the params:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_final/app/js/phone_detail/PhoneDetail.ts', null, 'app/js/phone_detail/PhoneDetail.ts')

:marked
  We should also make the corresponding change in the unit test. We provide
  an instance of the `RouteParams` class instead of the `$routeParams` object:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_final/test/unit/PhoneDetail.spec.ts', 'routeparams', 'test/unit/PhoneDetail.spec.ts')

:marked
  With that, we're ready to switch the bootstrap method of the application from that
  of the `UpgradeAdapter` to the main Angular 2 `bootstrap`. Let's import it together
  with a couple of other things in `app.module.ts`
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_final/app/js/app.ts', 'importbootstrap')

:marked
  We'll now use the regular Angular 2 `bootstrap` function to bootstrap the app 
  instead of using `UpgradeAdapter`. The first argument to `bootstrap` is the
  application's root component `AppComponent`, and the second
  is an array of the Angular 2 providers that we want to make available for
  injection. In that array we include all the things we have been registering
  with  `upgradeAdapter.addProvider` until now, as well as the providers and
  directives of the router:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_final/app/js/app.ts', 'bootstrap')

:marked
  We are now running a pure Angular 2 application!
  
  But there's actually one more cool thing we can do with the new router.
  We no longer have to hardcode the links to phone details from the phone 
  list, because the Angular 2 router is able to generate them for us with
  its `routerLink` directive. We just need to refer to the route names we
  used in the `@RouteConfig`:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_final/app/js/phone_list/phone_list.html', 'list', 'app/js/phone_list/phone_list.html')

:marked
  For this to work the directive just needs to be declared in the component:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_final/app/js/phone_list/PhoneList.ts', 'top')

:marked
  To bring our Protractor test suite up to speed with the latest changes,
  there are a few remaining things we need to do. Firstly, now that we're
  no longer running Angular 1 at all, we should let Protractor know it
  should not be looking for one but instead find *Angular 2 apps* from
  the page. Add the following configuration option to `protractor-conf.js`:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_final/test/protractor-conf.js', 'ng2')

:marked
  Also, there are a couple of Protractor API calls in our test code that
  are using the Angular 1 `$location` service under the hood. As that
  service is no longer there, we need to replace those calls with ones
  that use WebDriver's generic URL APIs instead. The first of these is
  the redirection spec:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_final/test/e2e/scenarios.ts', 'redirect')

:marked
  And the second is the phone links spec:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_final/test/e2e/scenarios.ts', 'links')

:marked
  Now our E2E test suite is passing too, and we're ready to remove
  Angular 1 from the project!

  ## Saying Goodbye to Angular 1

  It is time to take off the training wheels and let our application begin
  its new life as a pure, shiny Angular 2 app. The remaining tasks all have to
  do with removing code - which of course is every programmer's favorite task!
  
  First, rename `app.module.ts` to `app.ts`. It will no longer be setting up
  an Angular 1 module, so it doesn't really make sense to call it a module.
  Then remove all references to the `UpgradeAdapter` from `app.ts`. Also remove
  the Angular 1 bootstrap code, type definitions, and the imports of the `core`,
  `phoneList`, and `phoneDetail` modules. Instead import the `PhoneList` and `PhoneDetail`
  components directly - they are needed in the route configuration.
  
  When you're done, this is what `app.ts` should look like:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_final/app/js/app.ts', null, 'app/js/app.ts')

:marked
  You may also completely remove the following files. They are Angular 1
  module configuration files and type definition files, and not required
  in Angular 2:
  
  * `app/js/core/core.module.ts` (also `app/js/core/upgrade_adapter.ts`)
  * `app/js/phone_detail/phone_detail.module.ts`
  * `app/js/phone_list/phone_list.module.ts`
  * `test/test_helper.ts`

  Finally, from `index.html` and `karma.conf.js`, remove all references to
  Angular 1 scripts as well as jQuery. When you're done, this is what `index.html`
  should look like:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_final/app/index.html', null, 'app/index.html')

:marked
  And this is what `karma.conf.js` should look like:
  
+makeExample('upgrade/ts/ng2_final/test/karma.conf.1.js', null, 'test/karma.conf.js')

:marked
  That is the last we'll see of Angular 1! It has served us well but now
  it's time to say goodbye.
