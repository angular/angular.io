  In this chapter we will
  * write an attribute directive to change the background color
  * apply the attribute directive to an element in a template
  * respond to user-initiated events
  * pass values into the directive using data binding

  ## Directives overview
  
  There are three kinds of directives in Angular:
  1. Components
  1. Structural directives  
  1. Attribute directives

  The *Component* is really a directive with a template. 
  It's the most common of the three directives and we write lots of them as we build our application.

  The *Structural* directive changes the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements. 
  [NgFor](template-syntax.html#ng-for) and [NgIf](template-syntax.html#ng-if) are two familiar examples.
  
  The *Attribute* directive changes the appearance or behavior of an element.
  The built-in [NgStyle](template-syntax.html#ng-style) directive, for example,
  can change several element styles at the same time.
  
  We are going to write our own attribute directive to set an element's background color
  when the user hovers over that element.

    We don't need *any* directive to simply set the background color.
    We can set it with the special [Style Binding](template-syntax.html#style-binding) like this:
  code-example.
    &lt;p [style.background]="'lime'">I am green with envy!&lt;/p>
  <br>
  :marked
    That wouldn't be nearly as much fun as creating our own directive.
    
    Besides, we're not just *setting* the color; we'll be *changing* the color
    in response to a user action, a mouse hover.

  ## Build a simple attribute directive
  An attribute directive minimally requires building a controller class annotated with a 
  `Directive` decorator. The `Directive` decorator specifies the selector identifying
  the attribute associated with the directive. 
  The controller class implements the desired directive behavior.

  Let's build a small illustrative example together.

  ### Setup
  Create a new project folder (`attribute-directives`) and follow the steps in the [QuickStart](../quickstart.html).
  
  As in the [tutorial](/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/), we'll rename `app.ts` to `app.component.ts`
  and relocate the call to `bootstrap` to a separate `boot.ts` file.
+makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/boot.ts', null, 'app/boot.ts')
:marked
  A clean `app.component.ts` without bootstrapping is much easer to test.
  
  Finally, we remember to update `index.html` to load `boot.ts`
  
code-example.
  System.import('app/boot');
:marked
  ### Write the directive
  Add a new file to the `app` folder called `highlight.directive.ts` and add the following code:
+makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/highlight.directive.1.ts', null, 'app/highlight.directive.ts')

:marked
  We begin by importing some symbols from the Angular library.
  We need the `Directive` symbol for the `@Directive` decorator.
  We need symbols for the *Element Reference* and the *Renderer* service that
  we will [inject](dependency-injection.html) into the directive's constructor.
  We don't need `Input` now but we will need it later in the chapter.
  
  Then we define the directive metadata in a configuration object passed
  as an argument to the `@Directive` decorator function. 
  A `@Directive` decorator for an attribute directive requires a css selector to identify
  the HTML in the template that is associated with our directive.
  The [css selector for an attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors)
  is the attribute name in square brackets.
  
  Our directive's selector is `[my-highlight]`. 
  Angular will locate all elements in the template that have an attribute named `my-highlight`. 
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    ### Why not call it "highlight"?
    *highlight* is a nicer name than *my-highlight* and, technically, it would work if we called it that.
    However, the good folks at Angular strongly prefer hyphenated directive selector names. 
    The HTML standards body will never name one of its attributes with a hyphen and there is
    less risk of colliding with a third-party directive name when we give ours a prefix.
    The `ng-` prefix belongs to Angular. 
    We need a prefix of our own, preferably short, and `my-` will do for now.
:marked
  After the `@Component` metadata comes the directive's controller class which we are exporting
  to make it accessible to other components. 
  The directive's controller class contains the logic for our directive.
  
  Angular creates a new instance of the directive's controller class for
  each matching element, injecting  an *Element Reference* and 
  the *Renderer* service as arguments to our constructor. 
  We'll need them to set the element's background color.
    
  Our code shows two ways to do that.
  
  We could access the `nativeElement` property of the element reference 
  and set the element's background using the browser DOM API. We don't need
  the `Renderer` for this technique. But we commented it out.

  We chose the second way, the preferred way, that relies on the `Renderer` service
  to set the element properties.

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    ### Why prefer the Renderer?
    Manipulating the DOM directly is a practice we should *avoid* because it chains us
    to the browser DOM API.
    
    The  `Renderer` insulates our code from the browser's API. 
    That gives us options.
    The rendering phase could be offloaded to a Web Worker for faster performance.
    Our directive might work when we ran the application outside the browser,
    perhaps on the server in a pre-render phase. 
    Server-side rendering can make our application load faster and
    is often friendlier to Search Engine Optimizations (SEO).

  ## Apply the attribute directive
  The `AppComponent` will be the test harness for our `highlight` directive.
  Let's give it a new template that 
  applies the directive as an attribute to a `span` element.
  In Angular terms, the `<span>` element will be the attribute **host**.
  
  We'll put the template in its own `app.component.html` file that looks like this:
+makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/app.component.1.html',null,'app/app.component.html')
:marked
  A separate template file is clearly overkill for a 2-line template. 
  Hang in there; we're going to expand it later.
  Meanwhile, we'll revise the `AppComponent` to reference this template.
+makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/app.component.ts',null,'app/app.component.ts')
:marked
  We've added an `import` statement to fetch the 'Highlight' directive and 
  added that class to a `directives` array in the component metadata so that Angular 
  will recognize our directive when it encounters `my-highlight` in the template. 
  Angular would simply ignore the `my-highlight` attribute without it.
  
  We run the app and see that our directive highlights the span text.

  img(src="/resources/images/devguide/attribute-directives/first-highlight.png" alt="First Highlight")
:marked
  Let's recap what happened.
  
  Angular found the `my-highlight` attribute on the `<span>` element. It created
  an instance of the `Highlight` directive class, 
  injecting both a reference to the element and the `Renderer` service into the constructor.
  The constructor told the `Renderer` to set the `<span>` element's background style to yellow.

  ## Respond to user action

  We are not satisfied to simply set an element color.
  Our directive should set the color in response to a user action.
  Specifically, we want to set the color when the user mouses over the element.
  
  We'll need to
  1. detect when the user mouses into and out of the element
  1. respond to those actions by setting and clearing the highlight color.
  
  Start with event detection. 
  We add a `host` property to the directive metadata and give it a configuration object
  that specifies two mouse events and the directive methods to call when they are raised.
+makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/highlight.directive.2.ts','host')
:marked
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    The `host` property refers to the DOM element that hosts our attribute directive, the `<span>` in our case.
     
    We could have attached an event listener to the native element (`el.nativeElement`) with 
    plain old JavaScript. 
    There are at least three problems with that approach:
    
    1. We have to write the listeners correctly.
    1. We must *detach* our listener when the directive is destroyed to avoid memory leaks.
    1. We'd be talking to DOM API directly which, we learned, is something to avoid.

    Let's roll with the `host` property. 
:marked
  Now we implement those two mouse event handlers:
+makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/highlight.directive.2.ts','mouse-methods')
:marked
  Notice that they delegate to a helper method that calls the `Renderer` service
  as we used to do in the constructor.
  
  We no longer need the constructor body but 
  we still want the injected `ElementRef` and `Renderer` service.
  We revise the constructor signature to capture the injectables in private variables
  and clear the body.
+makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/highlight.directive.2.ts','ctor')
:marked
  Here's the updated directive:
+makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/highlight.directive.2.ts',null, 'app/highlight.directive.ts')
:marked
  We run the app and confirm that the background color appears as we move the mouse over the `span` and
  disappears as we move out.

.l-main-section

  ## Configure the directive with binding

  Currently the highlight color is hard-coded within the directive. That's inflexible.
  We should set the highlight color externally with a binding like this:
+makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/app.component.html','span')
:marked
  We'll extend our directive class with a bindable **input** `highlightColor` property and use it when we highlight text.

  Here is the final version of the class:
  
+makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/highlight.directive.ts', 'class-1', 'app/highlight.directive.ts (class only)')
:marked
  The new `highlightColor` property is called an "input" property because data flows from the binding expression into our directive.
  Notice that we call the `@Input()` decorator function while defining the property.
+makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/highlight.directive.ts', 'color')
:marked
  This `@Input` decorator adds metadata to the class that makes the `highlightColor` property  available for property binding
  under the `my-highlight` alias. 
  We must add this input metadata. Angular will give us an error if we try to bind 
  to a property without declaring it as an input.
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    The developer who uses our directive expects to bind to the attribute name, `my-highlight`.
    The directive property name is `highlightColor`. That's a disconnect.
    
    We can resolve the discrepancy by renaming the property to `myHighlight` and define it as follows:

  +makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/highlight.directive.ts', 'highlight')
  <br>
  :marked
    We don't like that property name. 
    We prefer, in this case, to **alias** the `highlightColor` property with the attribute name by
    passing `my-highlight` into the `@Input` decorator:
  +makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/highlight.directive.ts', 'color')
:marked
  Now that we're getting the highlight color as an input, we modify the `onMouseEnter()` method to use
  it instead of the hard-coded color name.
  We also define a red default color as a fallback in case
  the user neglects to bind with a color.
+makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/highlight.directive.ts', 'mouse-enter')
:marked
  Now we'll update our `AppComponent` template to let 
  users pick the highlight color and bind their choice to our directive.
  
  Here is the updated template:

+makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/app.component.html', 'v2')

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    ### Where is the templated *color* property?
    
    The eagle-eyed may notice that the radio button click handlers in the template set a `color` property
    and we are binding that `color` to the directive. 
    We should expect to find a `color` on the host `AppComponent`.
    
    **We never defined a color property for the host *AppComponent***!
    And yet this code works. Where is the template `color` value going?
    
    Browser debugging reveals that Angular dynamically added a `color` property 
    to the runtime instance of the `AppComponent`.
    
    This is *convenient* behavior but it is also *implicit* behavior that could be confusing. 
    While it's cool that this technique works, we recommend adding the `color` property to the `AppComponent`.

:marked
  Here is our second version of the directive in action.

  img(src="/resources/images/devguide/attribute-directives/highlight-directive-v2-anim.gif" alt="Highlight v.2")

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Bind to a second property
  Our directive only has a single, customizable property. What if we had ***two properties***?
  
  Let's let the template developer set the default color, the color that prevails until the user picks a highlight color.
  We'll add a second **input** property to `HighlightDirective` called `defaultColor`:
+makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/highlight.directive.ts', 'defaultColor')
:marked
  The `defaultColor` property has a setter that overrides the hard-coded default color, "red".
  We don't need a getter.
  
  How do we bind to it? We already "burned" the `my-highlight` attribute name as a binding target.
  
  Remember that a *component is a directive too*. 
  We can add as many component property bindings as we need by stringing them along in the template
  as in this example that sets the `a`, `b`, `c` properties to the string literals 'a', 'b', and 'c'. 
  ```
  <my-component [a]="'a'" [b]="'b'" [c]="'c'"><my-component>
  ```
  We do the same thing with an attribute directive.
+makeExample('attribute-directives/ts/src/app/app.component.html', 'defaultColor')
:marked
  Here we're binding the user's color choice to the `my-highlight` attribute as we did before.
  We're *also* binding the literal string, 'violet', to the `defaultColor` 
  (remembering to spell that property in "kebab-case" as *default-color*).
    
  Here is the final version of the directive in action.

  ## Summary
  Now we know how to
  - build a simple **attribute directive** to attach behavior to an HTML element,
  - use that directive in a template,
  - respond to **events** to change behavior based on an event,
  - and use **binding** to pass values to the attribute directive.
