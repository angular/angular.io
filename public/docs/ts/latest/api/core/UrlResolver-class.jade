    :markdown
      Resolves the `url` given the `baseUrl`:
      - when the `url` is null, the `baseUrl` is returned,
      - if `url` is relative ('path/to/here', './path/to/here'), the resolved url is a combination of
      `baseUrl` and `url`,
      - if `url` is absolute (it has a scheme: 'http://', 'https://' or start with '/'), the `url` is
      returned as is (ignoring the `baseUrl`)
