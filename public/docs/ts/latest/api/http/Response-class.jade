:markdown
  Creates `Response` instances from provided values.
  
  Though this object isn't
  usually instantiated by end-users, it is the primary object interacted with when it comes time to
  add data to a view.
  
  #Example
  
  ```
  http.request('my-friends.txt').subscribe(response => this.friends = response.text());
  ```
  
  The Response's interface is inspired by the Response constructor defined in the [Fetch
  Spec](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response-class), but is considered a static value whose body
  can be accessed many times. There are other differences in the implementation, but this is the
  most significant.
