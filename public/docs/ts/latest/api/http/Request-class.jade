  Creates `Request` instances from provided values.
  
  The Request's interface is inspired by the Request constructor defined in the [Fetch
  Spec](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#request-class),
  but is considered a static value whose body can be accessed many times. There are other
  differences in the implementation, but this is the most significant.
