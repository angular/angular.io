  # Angular Cookbook
  
  The *Cookbook* offers answers to common implementation questions.
  
  Each cookbook chapter is a collection of recipes focused on a particular Angular feature or application challenge
  such as data binding, cross-component interaction, and communicating with a remote server via HTTP.

    The cookbook is just getting started. Many more recipes are on the way.

  Each cookbook chapter links to a live sample with every recipe included.
  
  Recipes are deliberately brief and code-centric. 
  Each recipe links to a chapter of the Developer Guide or the API Guide
  where you can learn more about the purpose, context, and design choices behind the code snippets.
