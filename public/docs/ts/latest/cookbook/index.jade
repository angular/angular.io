  The *Cookbook* offers answers to common implementation questions.

  Each cookbook page is a collection of recipes focused on a particular Angular feature or application challenge
  such as data binding, cross-component interaction, and communicating with a remote server via HTTP.

    The cookbook is just getting started. Many more recipes are on the way.

:marked
  Each cookbook links to a live sample with every recipe included.

  Recipes are deliberately brief and code-centric.
  Each recipe links to a relevant page of the [Developer Guide](../guide) or the
  [API Reference](../api) where you can learn more about
  the purpose, context, and design choices behind the code snippets.
