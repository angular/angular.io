  ## Angular and _i18n_ template translation

  Application internationalization is a challenging, many-faceted effort that 
  takes dedication and enduring commitment.
  Angular's _i18n_ internationalization facilities can help.

  This page describes the _i18n_ tools to assist translation of component template text
  into multiple languages.


.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Practitioners of _internationalization_ refer to a translatable text as a "_message_".
    This page uses the words "_text_" and "_message_" interchangably and in the combination, "_text message_".
  
:marked
  The _i18n_ template translation process has four phases:

  1. Mark static text messages in your component templates for translation.
  
  1. An angular _i18n_ tool extracts the marked messages into an industry standard translation source file.

  1. A translator edits that file, translating the extracted text messages into the target language, 
  and returns the file to you.

  1. The Angular compiler imports the completed translation files, 
  replaces the original messages with translated text, and generates a new version of the application
  in the target language.

  You build and deploy a separate version of the application for each supported language.

a#i18n-attribute
.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Mark text with the _i18n_ attribute
  
  The Angular `i18n` attribute is a marker for translatable content.
  Place it on every element tag whose fixed text should be translated.

.alert.is-helpful
  :marked
    `i18n` is not an Angular _directive_. 
    It's a custom _attribute_, recognized by Angular tools and compilers.
    It will be removed by the compiler _after_ translation.

:marked
  In the accompanying sample, an `<h1>` tag displays a simple English language greeting which you will translate to Spanish:
+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/app/app.component.1.html', 'greeting', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")
:marked
  Add the `i18n` attribute to the tag to mark it for translation.

+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/app/app.component.1.html', 'i18n-attribute', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

:marked
  The translator may need a description of the message to translate it accurately.
  Assign a description to the i18n attribute:
  
+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/app/app.component.1.html', 'i18n-attribute-desc', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

:marked
  The true _meaning_ of the text may require some application context.
  Add a contextual meaning to the assigned string, separating it from the description with the `|` character:
  
+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/app/app.component.html', 'i18n-attribute-meaning', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

:marked
  While all appearance of a message with the _same_ meaning have the _same_ translation, 
  a message with *different meanings* could have different translations.
  The Angular extraction tool preserves both the _meaning_ and the _description_ in the translation source file
  to facilitiate contextually-specific translations.

  Also, if you want to translate some content without having to create a new element, you can use a `<ng-container>`
  which doesn't get renderered in the DOM:

+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/app/app.component.html', 'i18n-ng-container', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

:marked
  You can also use a pair of comments to get the same result:

+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/app/app.component.html', 'i18n-with-comment', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

a#translate-attributes
:marked
  ## Translating attributes with _i18n-x_
  Now you add an image to your html and since you are concerned with a11y, you add an `alt` tag to it:

+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/app/app.component.1.html', 'i18n-alt', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

:marked
  Such attribute needs to be translated as well, and `Angular` provides you another attribute: `i18n-x` where `x` is the
  name of the attribute to translate. In order to translate the `alt` on the `img` tag from the previous ex, you would write:

+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/app/app.component.html', 'i18n-alt-translate', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

:marked
  This attribute also supports the notation `i18n-x="m|d"`.

a#plural
:marked
  ## Plurals
  You have an application that counts animals. You need to keep in mind that it is `one wolf` but also `two wolves`.
  Also different languages could have different number of plural forms. Let's see how can you do that:

+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/app/app.component.html', 'i18n-plural', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

:marked
  * The first parameter is the key, which is a variable in your component that counts how many wolves we have.
  * The second parameter indicates that you are using the `plural form`.
  * The third parameter is the matches, in other words, how you define your plurals.

  So how do you define your plurals? It uses [CLDR data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Locale_Data_Repository).

  CLDR uses some tags to define plural categories, here is a few of them:

  * zero
  * =1
  * five / =5
  * =9
  * few
  * other

  A category like `=1` matches the number `1` but a category like `one` could match `1` as well as `21` in Belarusian.
  Keep in mind that categories like `=1` will take precedence over one like `one`.

  Along the category, you add the default _English_ translation, so for 2 wolves you can say `two {two wolves}` or `=2 {two wolves}`.
  If you use `other`, any non matched number will use the `other` translation.

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    The syntax for doing plurals is defined in [ICU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Components_for_Unicode).

a#select
:marked
  ## Select
  A select uses ICU syntax as well, but instead of giving a different value based on a number, you give
  different values based on a string.

  A hero can be male or female and you distinguish them with a variable that is either `m` or `f`. To translate that, you can do:

+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/app/app.component.html', 'i18n-select', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

:marked
  It has the same syntax as plural. First we define our variable, then the `select form` and last how we define our select.
  In this case the category is the content of the variable, in other words either `m` or `f`.

a#ng-xi18n
.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Create a translation source file with the _ng-xi18n_ tool
  
  Use the `ng-xi18n` extraction tool to extract the `i18n`-marked texts 
  into a translation source file in an industry standard format.
  
  This is an Angular CLI tool in the `@angular/compiler-cli` npm package.
  If you haven't already installed the CLI and its `platform-server` peer dependency, do so now:
  
code-example(language="sh" class="code-shell").
  npm install @angular/compiler-cli @angular/platform-server --save

:marked
  Open a terminal window at the root of the application project and enter the `ng-xi18n` command:
 
code-example(language="sh" class="code-shell").
  ./node_modules/.bin/ng-xi18n

:marked
  By default the tool generates a translation file named **`messages.xlf`** in the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLIFF" target="_blank">XML Localisation Interchange File Format (XLIFF, version 1.2)</a>.

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Windows users may have to quote the command:
  code-example(language="sh").
    "./node_modules/.bin/ng-xi18n"
  :marked
    Consider adding a convenience shortcut to the `scripts` section of the `package.json`
    to make the command easier to remember and run:
  code-example(format='.').
    "scripts": {
      "i18n": "ng-xi18n", 
      ...
    }
  :marked
    Now you can enter:
  code-example(language="sh" class="code-shell").
    npm run i18n

:marked
  ### Other translation formats

  You can generate a file named **`messages.xmb`** in the 
  <a href="http://cldr.unicode.org/development/development-process/design-proposals/xmb"  target="_blank">XML Message Bundle (XMB)</a> format
  by adding the `--i18nFormat=xmb` switch.

code-example(language="sh" class="code-shell").
  ./node_modules/.bin/ng-xi18n  --i18nFormat=xmb

:marked
  This sample sticks with the _XLIFF_ format.

a#translate
.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Translate _los mensajes de texto_
  
  The `ng-xi18n` command generated a translation source file in the project root folder named `messages.xlf`.
  The next step is to translate the English language template text into the specific language translation
  files. The cookbook sample creates a Spanish translation file.

a#localization-folder
:marked
  ### Create a localization folder

  You will probably translate into more than one other language so it's a good idea
  for the project structure to reflect your entire internationalization effort.
  
  One approach is to dedicate a folder to localization and store related assets 
  (e.g. internationalization files) there.
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Localization and internationalization are 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization" target="_blank">different but closely related terms</a>.
:marked
  This sample follows that suggestion. It has `locale` folder immediately under the project root.
  Assets within the folder carry a filename extension that matches a language-culture code from a
  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee825488(v=cs.20).aspx" target="_blank">well-known codeset</a>.

  Move `messages.xlf` into the `locale` folder where it will become the source for all language-specific translations.
  Then make a copy for the Spanish language named `messages.es.xlf` .

  Follow the same convention for each target language.

  ### Translate text nodes
  In the real world, you send the `messages.es.xlf` file to a Spanish translator who would fill in the translations
  using one of the 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLIFF#Editors" target="_blank">many XLIFF file editors</a>.

  This sample file is easy to translate without a special editor or knowledge of Spanish.
  Open `messages.es.xlf` and find the first `<trans-unit>` section:

+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/locale/trans-unit.html', 'translate-hello', 'locale/messages.es.xlf (<trans-unit>)')(format=".")
:marked
  This XML element represents the translation of the `<h1>` greeting tag you marked with the `i18n` attribute. 
  
  Using the _source_, _description_, and _meaning_ elements to guide your translation,
  replace the `<target/>` tag with the Spanish greeting:
+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/locale/messages.es.xlf.html', 'translated-hello', 'locale/messages.es.xlf (<trans-unit>, after translation)')(format=".")
:marked
  Note that the `id` is generated by the tool. Don't touch it.
  Its value depends on the content of the message and its assigned meaning.
  Change either factor and the `id` changes as well.

  Translating the text nodes within the `<ng-container>`, `<!--i18n-->` and also the attributes with `i18n-x` are done in the same way:

+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/locale/messages.es.xlf.html', 'translated-other-nodes', 'locale/messages.es.xlf (<trans-unit>)')(format=".")

:marked
  ### Translate plural and select
  To translate a `plural` or a `select`, you provide the same ICU string but changing the matches:

+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/locale/messages.es.xlf.html', 'translated-plural', 'locale/messages.es.xlf (<trans-unit>)')(format=".")

:marked
  For `select` is the same, but let's check the `select` again:

+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/app/app.component.html', 'i18n-select', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

:marked
  It contains some text apart from the ICU. That text will appear as a separate `trans-unit`:

+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/locale/trans-unit.html', 'translate-select-node', 'locale/messages.es.xlf (<trans-unit>)')(format=".")

:marked
  So, what is that `<x id="ICU">`? That tag is a _placeholder_ that represents the ICU. Translate the text
  and leave the tag in place. Here is both the text and `select` translated:

+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/locale/messages.es.xlf.html', 'translated-select', 'locale/messages.es.xlf (<trans-unit>)')(format=".")

.alert.is-helpful
  :marked
    Notice that for plural and select, there is nothing in the `<source>` tag.
    As today, ICU are not supported with xliff, but they are with xmb.
    Support will come soon.

.l-main-content
:marked
  The application is fully translated. Let's make use of it.

.alert.is-helpful
  :marked
    Repeat the extraction process whenever you add new app messages or edit existing ones.
    Be careful not to lose the previous translations.
    Specialized software can help manage the change process.

#app-pre-translation
:marked
  ### The app before translation

  After the previous steps, the sample app _and_ its translation file are as follows:

+makeTabs(`
  cb-i18n/ts/app/app.component.html,
  cb-i18n/ts/app/app.component.ts,
  cb-i18n/ts/app/app.module.ts,
  cb-i18n/ts/app/main.1.ts,
  cb-i18n/ts/locale/messages.es.xlf.html
`, '', `
  app/app.component.html,
  app/app.component.ts,
  app/app.module.ts,
  app/main.ts,
  locale/messages.es.xlf
`)

a#merge
.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Merge the completed translation file

  To merge the translated text into component templates,
  you compile the application with the completed translation file.
  The process is the same whether the file is in `.xlf` format or 
  in one of the other formats (`.xlif` and `.xtb`) that Angular understands.
  
  You provide the Angular compiler with three new pieces of information:
    * the translation file
    * the translation file format 
    * the   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLIFF" target="_blank">_Locale ID_</a>
    (`es` or `en-US` for instance)
  
  _How_ you provide this information depends upon whether you compile with
  the JiT (_Just-in-Time_) compiler or the AoT (_Ahead-of-Time_) compiler. 
  
    * with [JiT](#jit), you provide the information at bootstrap time.
    * with [AoT](#aot), you pass the information as `ngc` options. 

a#jit
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Merge with the JiT compiler
  
  The JiT (_Just-in-Time_) compiler compiles the application in the browser as the application loads.
  Translation with the JiT compiler is a dynamic process of ...

  1. determining the language version for the current user,
  2. importing the appropriate language translation file as a string constant,
  3. creating corresponding translation providers to guide the JiT compiler,
  4. bootstrapping the application with those providers.

  Open `index.html` and revise the launch script as shown here:
+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/index.html', 'i18n', 'index.html (launch script)')(format='.')
:marked
  In this sample, the user's language is hardcoded as a global `document.locale` variable
  in the `index.html`.

a#text-plugin
:marked
  ### SystemJS Text plugin

  Notice the SystemJS mapping of `text` to a `systemjs-text-plugin.js`.
  With the help of a text pluglin, SystemJS can read any file as raw text and
  return the contents as a string.
  You'll need it to import the language translation file.

  SystemJS doesn't ship with a raw text plugin but it's easy to add.
  Create the following `systemjs-text-plugin.js` in the root folder:
+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/systemjs-text-plugin.js', null, 'systemjs-text-plugin.js')(format='.')
:marked
  ### Create translation providers

  Three providers tell the JiT compiler how to translate the template texts for a particular language
  while compiling the application:

  * `TRANSLATIONS` is a string containing the content of the translation file.
  * `TRANSLATIONS_FORMAT` is the format of the file: `xlf`, `xlif` or `xtb`
  * `LOCALE_ID` is the locale of the target language.

  The `getTranslationProviders` function in the following `app/i18n-providers.ts` 
  creates those providers based on the user's _locale_
  and the corresponding translation file:
+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/app/i18n-providers.ts', null, 'app/i18n-providers.ts')
:marked
  * It gets the locale from the global `document.locale` variable that was set in `index.html`.

  * If there is no locale or the language is U.S. English (`en-US`), there is no need to translate.
    The function returns an empty `noProviders` array as a `Promise`.
    It must return a `Promise` because this function could read a translation file asynchronously from the server.

  * It creates a transaction filename from the locale according to the name and location convention 
  [described earlier](#localization-folder).

  * The `getTranslationsWithSystemJs` method reads the translation and returns the contents as a string.
  Notice that it appends `!text` to the filename, telling SystemJS to use the [text plugin](#text-plugin). 

  * The callback composes a providers array with the three translation providers.

  * Finally, `getTranslationProviders` returns the entire effort as a promise.

  ### Bootstrap the app with translation providers

  The Angular `bootstrapModule` method has a second, _options_ parameter
  that can influence the behavior of the compiler.

  You'll create an _options_ object with the translation providers from `getTranslationProviders`
  and pass it to `bootstrapModule`.
  Open the `app/main.ts` and modify the bootstrap code as follows:
+makeExample('cb-i18n/ts/app/main.ts', null, 'app/main.ts')(format=".")
:marked
  Notice that it waits for the `getTranslationProviders` promise to resolve before
  bootstrapping the app.

  The app is now _internationalized_ for English and Spanish and there is a clear path for adding
  more languages.

a#aot
.l-main-section

  ### _Internationalize_ with the AoT compiler
  
  The JiT compiler translates the application into the target language while compiling dynamically in the browser.
  That's flexible but may not be fast enough for your users. 
  
  The AoT (_Ahead-of-Time_) compiler is part of a build process that produces a small, fast, ready-to-run application package.
  When you internationalize with the AoT compiler, you pre-build a separate application package for each
  language. Then in the host web page (`index.html`), you determine which language the user needs
  and serve the appropriate application package.

  This cookbook doesn't cover how to build multiple application packages and 
  serve them according to the user's language preference.
  It does explain the few steps necessary to tell the AoT to apply a translations file.

  Internationalization with the AoT compiler requires some setup specifically for AoT. 
  Start with application project as shown [just before merging the translation file](#app-pre-translationStart)
  and refer to the [AoT cookbook](aot-compiler.html) to make it _AoT-ready_.
  
  Next, issue an `ngc` compile command for each supported language (including English).
  The result is a separate version of the application for each language.
  
  Tell AoT how to translate by adding three options to the `ngc` command:
    * `--i18nFile`: the path to the translation file
    * `--locale`: the name of the locale
    * `--i18nFormat`: the format of the localization file
  
  For this sample, the Spanish language command would be
code-example(language="sh" class="code-shell").
  ./node_modules/.bin/ngc --i18nFile=./locale/messages.es.xlf --locale=es --i18nFormat=xlf

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Windows users may have to quote the command:
  code-example(language="sh" class="code-shell").
    "./node_modules/.bin/ngc" --i18nFile=./locale/messages.es.xlf --locale=es --i18nFormat=xlf
