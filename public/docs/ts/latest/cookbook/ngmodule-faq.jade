  **Angular Modules** help organize an application into cohesive blocks of functionality.

  The [Angular Modules chapter](../guide/ngmodule.html) covers the concepts and takes you step by step
  from the most elementary `@NgModule` to a multi-faceted sample with lazy loaded modules.

  _This_ chapter answers the questions many developers ask about Angular Module design and implementation.

  ### What classes should I add to _declarations_?

  Add [declarable](#q-declarable) classes &mdash; components, directives, and pipes &mdash; to a `declarations` list.

  These classes must be declared in _exactly one_ module of the application.
  Declare them in _this_ module if they _belong_ to this module.

.l-hr

a#q-declarable
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### What is a _declarable_?

  _Declarables_ are the class types &mdash; components, directives, and pipes &mdash;
  that you can add to a module's `declarations` list.
  They're the _only_ classes that you can add to `declarations`.

.l-hr

a#q-what-not-to-declare
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### What classes should I _not_ add to _declarations_?

  Only [declarable](#q-declarable) classes can be added to a module's `declarations` list.

  Do *not* declare
  * a class that is already declared in another module, whether an app module, @angular module, or 3rd party module

  * an array of directives imported from another module.
  For example, do not declare FORMS_DIRECTIVES from `@angular/forms`.

  * module classes

  * service classes

  * non-Angular classes and objects such as
  strings, numbers, functions, entity models, configurations, business logic, and helper classes.

  ### Why list the same component in multiple _NgModule_ properties?

  We often see `AppComponent` listed in both `declarations` and `bootstrap`.
  We might see `HeroComponent` listed in `declarations`, `exports`, and `entryComponents`.

  That _feels_ redundant but these properties have different functions
  and we can't infer that membership in one list implies membership in another list.

  * `AppComponent` could be declared in this module but not bootstrapped.
  * `AppComponent` could be bootstrapped in this module but declared in a different feature module.
  * `HeroComponent` could be imported from another app module (so we can't declare it) and re-exported by this module.
  * `HeroComponent` could be exported for inclusion in an external component's template and also dynamically loaded in a pop-up dialog.

  ### What does "_Can't bind to 'x' since it isn't a known property of 'y'_" mean?

  This error usually means either that you neglected to declare the directive "x"
  or you haven't imported the module to which "x" belongs.

  For example, if "x" is `ngModel`, you probably haven't imported the `FormsModule` from `@angular/forms`.

  Perhaps you declared "x" in an application sub-module but forgot to export it?
  The "x" class won't be visible to other modules until you add it to the `exports` list.

  ### What should I import?

  Import modules whose public (exported) [declarable classes](#q-declarable)
  you need to reference in this module's component templates.

  This invariably means importing `CommonModule` from `@angular/common` for access to
  the Angular directives such as `NgIf` and `NgFor`.
  You can import it directly or from another module that [re-exports](#q-reexport) it.

  Import `FormsModule` from `@angular/forms`
  if your components have `[(ngModel)]` two-way binding expressions.

  Import _shared_ and _feature_ modules when this module's components incorporate their
  components, directives, and pipes.

  Only [import _BrowserModule_](#q-browser-vs-common-module) in the root `AppModule`.

.l-hr

a#q-browser-vs-common-module
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Should I import _BrowserModule_ or _CommonModule_?

  The **root application module** (`AppModule`) of almost every browser application
  should import `BrowserModule` from `@angular/platform-browser`.

  `BrowserModule` provides services that are essential to launch and run a browser app.

  `BrowserModule` also re-exports `CommonModule` from `@angular/common`
  which means that components in the `AppModule` module also have access to
  the Angular directives every app needs such as `NgIf` and `NgFor`.

  _Do not import_ `BrowserModule` in any other module.
  *Feature modules* and *lazy loaded modules* should import `CommonModule` instead.
  They need the common directives. They don't need to re-install the app-wide providers.
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    `BrowserModule` throws an error if you try to lazy load  a module that imports it.
:marked
  Importing `CommonModule` also frees feature modules for use on _any_ target platform, not just browsers,
  a fact of some interest to authors of cross-platform libraries.

.l-hr
a#q-reimport
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### What if I import the same module twice?

  That's not a problem. When three modules all import Module 'A',
  Angular evaluates Module 'A' once, the first time it encounters it, and does not do so again.

  That's true at whatever level `A` appears in a hierarchy of imported modules.
  When Module 'B' imports Module 'A', Module 'C' imports 'B', and Module 'D' imports `[C, B, A]`,
  then 'D' triggers the evaluation of 'C' which triggers the evaluation of 'B' which evaluates 'A'.
  When Angular gets to the 'B' and 'A' in 'D', they're already cached and ready to go.

  Angular does not like modules with circular references so don't let Module 'A' import Module 'B' which imports Module 'A'.

.l-hr
a#q-what-to-export
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### What should I export?

  Export [declarable](#q-declarable) classes that components in _other_ modules
  should be able to reference in their templates. These are your _public_ classes.
  If you don't export a class, it stays _private_, visible only to other component
  declared in this module.

  You _can_ export any declarable class &mdash; components, directives, and pipes &mdash;
  whether it is declared in this module or in an imported module.

  You _can_ re-export entire imported modules which effectively re-exports all of their exported classes.
  A module can even export a module that it doesn't import.

.l-hr

a#q-what-not-to-export
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### What should I *not* export?

  Do *not* export

  * Private components, directives, and pipes that you need only within components declared in this module.
  If you don't want another module to see it, don't export it.

  * Non-declarable objects such as services, functions, configurations, entity models, etc.

  * Components that are only loaded dynamically by the router or by bootstrapping.
  Such [entry components](#q-entry-component-defined) can never be selected in another component's template.
  There's no harm in exporting them but no benefit either.

  * Pure service modules that don't have public (exported) declarations.
  For example, there is no point in re-exporting `HttpModule` because it doesn't export anything.
  It's only purpose is to add http service providers to the application as a whole.

.l-hr

a#q-reexport
a#q-re-export
.l-main-section

  ### Can I re-export classes and modules?

  Absolutely!

  Modules are a great way to selectively aggregate classes from other modules and
  re-export them in a consolidated, convenience module.

  A module can re-export entire modules which effectively re-exports all of their exported classes.
  Angular's own `BrowserModule` exports a couple of modules like this:
code-example.
  exports: [CommonModule, ApplicationModule]

:marked
  A module can export a combination of its own declarations, selected imported classes, and imported modules.
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Don't bother re-exporting pure service modules.
    Pure service modules don't export [declarable](#q-declarable) classes that another module could use.
    For example, there is no point in re-exporting `HttpModule` because it doesn't export anything.
    It's only purpose is to add http service providers to the application as a whole.

.l-hr

a#q-for-root
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### What is the _forRoot_ method?

  The `forRoot` static method is a convention that makes it easy for developers to configure the module's provider(s).

  The `RouterModule.forRoot` method is a good example.
  Apps pass a `Routes` object to `RouterModule.forRoot` in order to configure the app-wide `Router` service with routes.
  `RouterModule.forRoot` returns a [ModuleWithProviders](../api/core/index/ModuleWithProviders-interface.html).
  We add that result to the `imports` list of the root `AppModule`.

.alert.is-important
  :marked
    Only call and import a `.forRoot` result in the root application module, `AppModule`.
    Importing it in any other module, particularly in a lazy loaded module,
    is contrary to the intent and is likely to produce a runtime error.
:marked
  `RouterModule` also offers a `forChild` static method for configuring the routes of lazy loaded modules.

  **_forRoot_** and **_forChild_** are conventional names for methods that
  configure services in root and feature modules respectively.

  Angular doesn't recognize these names but Angular developers do.
  Follow this convention when you write similar modules with configurable service providers.

.l-hr

a#q-module-provider-visibility
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Why is a service provided in a feature module visible everywhere?

  Providers listed in the `@NgModule.providers` of a bootstrapped module have **application scope**.
  Adding a service provider to `@NgModule.providers` effectively publishes the service to the entire application.

  When we import a module,
  Angular adds the module's service providers (the contents of its `providers` list)
  to the application _root injector_.

  This makes the provider visible to every class in the application that knows the provider's lookup token.

  This is by design.
  Extensibility through module imports is a primary goal of the Angular module system.
  Merging module providers into the application injector
  makes it easy for a module library to enrich the entire application with new services.
  By adding the `HttpModule` once, every application component can make http requests.

  However, this can feel like an unwelcome surprise if you are expecting the module's services
  to be visible only to the components declared by that feature module.
  If the `HeroModule` provides the `HeroService` and the root `AppModule` imports `HeroModule`,
  any class that knows the `HeroService` _type_ can inject that service,
  not just the classes declared in the `HeroModule`.

.l-hr

a#q-lazy-loaded-module-provider-visibility
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Why is a service provided in a lazy loaded module visible only to that module?

  Unlike providers of the modules loaded at launch,
  providers of lazy loaded modules are *module-scoped*.

  When the Angular router lazy-loads a module, it creates a new execution context.
  That [context has its own injector](#q-why-child-injector "Why Angular creates a child injector") which is a direct child of the application injector.

  The router adds the lazy module's providers and the providers of its imported modules to this child injector.

  These providers are insulated from changes to application providers with the same lookup token.
  When the router creates a component within the lazy loaded context,
  Angular prefers service instances created from these providers to the service instances of the application root injector.

.l-hr
a#q-module-provider-duplicates
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### What if two modules provide the _same_ service?

  When two imported modules, loaded at the same time, list a provider with the same token,
  the second module's provider "wins". That's because both providers are added to the same injector.

  When Angular looks to inject a service for that token,
  it creates and delivers the instance created by the second provider.

  _Every_ class that injects this service gets the instance created by the second provider.
  Even classes declared within the first module get the instance created by the second provider.
  _This can be an unwelcome surprise_.

  If Module A provides a service for token 'X' and imports a module B
  that also provides a service for token 'X', then Module A's service definition "wins".

  The service provided by the root `AppModule` takes precedence over services provided by imported modules.
  The `AppModule` always wins.

.l-hr

a#q-component-scoped-providers
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### How do I restrict service scope to a module?

  When a module is loaded at application launch,
  its `@NgModule.providers` have ***application-wide scope***.
  They are available for injection throughout the application.

  Imported providers are easily replaced by providers from another imported module.
  Such replacement may be by design. It could be unintentional and have adverse consequences.

.alert.is-important
  :marked
    As a general rule, import modules with providers _exactly once_, preferably in the application's _root module_.
    That's also usually the best place to configure, wrap, and override them.

:marked
  Suppose a module requires a customized `HttpBackend` that adds a special header for all Http requests.
  If another module elsewhere in the application also customizes `HttpBackend`
  or merely imports the `HttpModule`, it could override this module's `HttpBackend` provider,
  losing the special header. The server will reject http requests from this module.

.alert.is-important
  :marked
    Avoid this problem by importing the `HttpModule` only in the `AppModule`, the application _root module_.

:marked
  If you must guard against this kind of "provider corruption", *don't rely on a launch-time module's `providers`.*

  Load the module lazily if you can.
  Angular gives a [lazy-loaded module](#q-lazy-loaded-module-provider-visibility) its own child injector.
  The module's providers are visible only within the component tree created with this injector.

  If you must load the module eagerly, when the application starts,
  ***provide the service in a component instead.***

  Continuing with the same example, suppose the components of a module truly require a private, custom `HttpBackend`.

  Create a "top component" that acts as the root for all of the module's components.
  Add the custom `HttpBackend` provider to the top component's `providers` list rather than the module's `providers`.
  Recall that Angular creates a child injector for each component instance and populates the injector
  with the component's own providers.

  When a child of this component _asks_ for the `HttpBackend` service,
  Angular provides the local `HttpBackend` service,
  not the version provided in the application root injector.
  Child components will make proper http requests no matter what other modules do to `HttpBackend`.

  Be sure to create module components as children of this module's top component.

  You can embed the child components in the top component's template.
  Alternatively, make the top component a routing host by giving it a `<router-outlet>`.
  Define child routes and let the router load module components into that outlet.

  ### Should I add app-wide providers to the root _AppModule_ or the root _AppComponent_?

.alert.is-helpful
  :marked
    Register application-wide providers in the root `AppModule`, not in the `AppComponent`.
:marked
  Lazy-loaded modules and their components can inject `AppModule` services;
  they cannot inject `AppComponent` services.

  Register a service in `AppComponent` providers _only_ if the service must be hidden
  from components outside the `AppComponent` tree. This is a rare exceptional use case.

  More generally, [prefer registering providers in modules](#q-component-or-module) to registering in components.

  #### **_Discussion_:**
  Angular registers all startup module providers with the application root injector.
  The services created from root injector providers are available to the entire application.
  They are _application-scoped_.

  Certain services (e.g., the `Router`) only work when registered in the application root injector.

  By contrast, Angular registers `AppComponent` providers with the `AppComponent`'s own injector.
  `AppComponent`services are available only to that component and its component tree.
  They are _component-scoped_.

  The `AppComponent`'s injector is a _child_ of the root injector, one down in the injector hierarchy.
  That is _almost_ the entire application for apps that don't use the router.
  But "almost" isn't good enough for routed applications.

  `AppComponent` services don't exist at the root level where routing operates.
  Lazy loaded modules can't reach them.
  In the Angular Module Chapter sample applications, if we had registered `UserService` in the `AppComponent`,
  the `HeroComponent` couldn't inject it.
  The application  would fail the moment a user navigated to "Heroes".

.l-hr

a#q-component-or-module
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Should I add other providers to a module or a component?

  In general, prefer registering feature-specific providers in modules (`@NgModule.providers`)
  to registering in components (`@Component.providers`).

  Register a provider with a component when you _must_ limit the scope of a service instance
  to that component and its component tree.
  Apply the same reasoning to registering a provider with a directive.

  For example, a hero editing component that needs a private copy of a caching hero service should register
  the `HeroService` with the `HeroEditorComponent`.
  Then each new instance of the `HeroEditorComponent` gets its own cached service instance.
  The changes that editor makes to heroes in its service do not touch the hero instances elsewhere in the application.

  [Always register _application-wide_ services with the root `AppModule`](q-root-component-or-module),
  not the root `AppComponent`.

.l-hr
a#q-why-bad
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Why is it bad if _SharedModule_ provides a service to a lazy loaded module?

  This question arose in the [Angular Module](../guide/ngmodule.html#no-shared-module-providers) chapter
  when we discussed the importance of keeping providers out of the `SharedModule`.

  Suppose we had listed the `UserService` in the module's `providers` (which we did not).
  Suppose every module imports this `SharedModule` (which they all do).

  When the app starts, Angular eagerly loads the `AppModule` and the `ContactModule`.

  Both instances of the imported `SharedModule` would provide the `UserService`.
  Angular registers one of them in the root app injector (see [above](#q-reimport)).
  Then some component injects `UserService`, Angular finds it in the app root injector,
  and delivers the app-wide singleton `UserService`. No problem.

  Now consider the `HeroModule` _which is lazy loaded!_

  When the router lazy loads the `HeroModule`, it creates a child injector and registers the `UserService`
  provider with that child injector. The child injector is _not_ the root injector.

  When Angular creates a lazy `HeroComponent`, it must inject a `UserService`.
  This time it finds a `UserService` provider in the lazy module's _child injector_
  and creates a _new_ instance of the `UserService`.
  This is an entirely different `UserService` instance
  than the app-wide singleton version that Angular injected in one of the eagerly loaded components.

  That's almost certainly a mistake.
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Prove it for yourself.
    Run the <live-example name="ngmodule">live example</live-example>.
    Modify the `SharedModule` so that it provides the `UserService` rather than the `CoreModule`.
    Then toggle between the "Contact" and "Heroes" links a few times.
    The username goes bonkers as the Angular creates a new `UserService` instance each time.

.l-hr

a#q-why-child-injector
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Why does lazy loading create a child injector?

  Angular adds `@NgModule.providers` to the application root injector ... unless the module is lazy loaded.
  Then it creates a _child injector_ and adds the module's providers to the child injector.

  This means that a module behaves differently depending on whether it is loaded during application start
  or lazy loaded later. Neglecting that difference can lead to [adverse consequences](#q-why-bad).

  Why doesn't Angular add lazy loaded providers to the app root injector as it does for eagerly loaded modules?
  Why the inconsistency?

  The answer is grounded in a fundamental characteristic of the Angular dependency injection system.
  An injector can add providers _until it is first used_.
  Once an injector starts creating and delivering services, its provider list is frozen. No new providers allowed.

  When an applications starts, Angular first configures the root injector with the providers of all eagerly loaded modules
  _before_ creating its first component and injecting any of the provided services.
  Once the application begins, the app root injector is closed to new providers.

  Time passes. Application logic triggers lazy loading of a module.
  Angular must add the lazy loaded module's providers to an injector _somewhere_.
  It can't added them to the app root injector because that injector is closed to new providers.
  So Angular creates a new child injector for the lazy loaded module context.

.l-hr

a#q-is-it-loaded
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### How can I tell if a module or service was previously loaded?

  Some modules and its services should only be loaded once by the root `AppModule`.
  Importing the module a second time by lazy loading a module could [produce errant behavior](#q-why-bad)
  that may be difficult to detect and diagnose.

  We can guard against that danger by writing a constructor that attempts to inject the module or service
  from the root app injector. If the injection succeeds, the class has been loaded a second time.
  We can throw an error or take other remedial action.

  Certain Angular modules (such as `BrowserModule`) implements such a guard
  as does this Angular Module chapter sample's `CoreModule` constructor.

a#q-entry-component-defined
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### What is an _entry component_?

  Any component that Angular loads _imperatively_ by type is an _entry component_,

  A component loaded _declaratively_ via its selector is _not_ an entry component.

  Most application components are loaded declaratively.
  Angular uses the component's selector to locate the element in the template.
  It then creates the HTML representation of the component and inserts it into the DOM at the selected element.
  These are not entry components.

  A few components are only loaded dynamically and are _never_ referenced in a component template.

  The bootstrapped root `AppComponent` is an _entry component_.
  True, its selector matches an element tag in `index.html`.
  But `index.html` is not a component template and the `AppComponent`
  selector doesn't match an element in any component template.

  Angular loads `AppComponent` dynamically either because we listed it _by type_ in `@NgModule.bootstrap`
  or because we boostrapped it imperatively with the module's `ngDoBootstrap` method.

  Components in route definitions are also _entry components_.
  A route definition refers to a component by its _type_.
  The router ignores a routed component's selector (if it even has one) and
  loads the component dynamically into a `RouterOutlet`.

  The compiler can't discover these _entry components_ by looking for them in other component templates.
  We must tell it about them ... by adding them to the `entryComponents` list.

  Angular automatically adds two kinds of components to the module's `entryComponents`:
  1. the component in the `@NgModule.bootstrap` list
  1. components referenced in router configuration

  We don't have to mention these components explicitly although it does not harm to do so.

.l-hr

a#q-bootstrap_vs_entry_component
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### What's the difference between a _bootstrap_ component and an _entry component_?

  A bootstrapped component _is_ an [entry component](#q-entry-component-defined).
  It's an entry component that Angular loads into the DOM during the bootstrap (application launch) process.
  Other entry components are loaded dynamically by other means such as with the router.

  The `@NgModule.bootstrap` property tells the compiler _both_ that this is an entry component _and_
  that it should generate code to bootstrap the application with this component.

  There is no need to list a component in both the `bootstrap` and `entryComponent` lists
  although it is harmless to do so.

.l-hr

a#q-when-entry-components
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### When do I add components to _entryComponents_?

  Most application developers won't need to add components to the `entryComponents`.

  Angular adds certain components to _entry components_ automatically.
  Components listed in `@NgModule.bootstrap` are added automatically.
  Components referenced in router configuration are added automatically.
  These two mechanisms account for almost all entry components.

  If your app happens to bootstrap or dynamically load a component _by type_ in some other manner,
  you'll have to add it to `entryComponents` explicitly.

  Although it's harmless to add components to this list,
  it's best to add only the components that are truly _entry components_.
  Don't include components that [are referenced](#q-template-reference)
  in the templates of other components.

.l-hr

a#q-why-entry-components
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Why does Angular need _entryComponents_?
  _Entry components_ are also declared.
  Why doesn't the Angular compiler generate code for every component in `@NgModule.declarations`?
  Then we wouldn't need entry components.

  The reason is _tree shaking_. For production apps we want to load the smallest, fastest code possible.
  The code should contain only the classes that we actually need.
  It should exclude a component that's never used, whether or not that component is declared.

  In fact, many libraries declare and export components we'll never use.
  The _tree shaker_ will drop these components from the final code package
  if we don't reference them.

  If the [Angular compiler](#q-angular-compiler) generated code for every declared component,
  it would defeat the purpose of the tree shaker.

  Instead, the compiler adopts a recursive strategy that generates code only for the components we use.

  It starts with the entry components,
  then it generates code for the declared components it [finds](#q-template-reference) in an entry component's template,
  then for the declared components it discovers in the templates of previously compiled components,
  and so on. At the end of the process, it has generated code for every  entry component
  and every component reachable from an entry component.

  If a component isn't an _entry component_ or wasn't found in a template,
  the compiler omits it.

    The following is preliminary guidance based on early experience using Angular modules in a few applications.
    Read with appropriate caution and reflection.

:marked
  #### _SharedModule_
  Create a `SharedModule` with the components, directives, and pipes that you use
  everywhere in your app. This module should consist entirely of `declarations`
  most of them exported.

  It may re-export other [widget modules](#widget-feature-module) such as `CommonModule`,
  `FormsModule` and modules with the UI controls that you use most widely.

  It should ***not*** have `providers` for reasons [explained earlier](#q-why-bad).
  Nor should any of its imported or re-exported modules have `providers`.
  Know what you're doing and why if you deviate from this guideline.

  Import the `SharedModule` in your _feature_ modules,
  both those loaded when the app starts and those you lazy load later.

  #### _CoreModule_
  Create a `CoreModule` with `providers` for the singleton services you load when the application starts.

  Import `CoreModule` in the root `AppModule` only.
  Never import `CoreModule` in any module other than the root `AppModule`.

  Consider making `CoreModule` a [pure services module](#service-feature-module) with no `declarations`.

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    This chapter sample departs from that advice by declaring and exporting two components that are
    only used within the root `AppComponent` declared by `AppModule`.
    Someone following this guideline strictly would have declared these components in the `AppModule` instead.

:marked
  #### Feature Modules
  Create _Feature Modules_ around specific application business domains, user workflows, and utility collections.

  Feature modules tend to fall into one of these four groups:
    * [Domain Feature Modules](#domain-feature-module)
    * [Routed Feature Modules](#routed-feature-module)
    * [Routing Modules](#routing-module)
    * [Service Feature Modules](#service-feature-module)
    * [Widget Feature Modules](#widget-feature-module)

    Real world modules are often hybrids that knowingly deviate from the following guidelines.
    They are guidelines, not laws.
    Follow them until you have a good reason to do otherwise.

    td
      :marked
        Domain Feature Modules deliver a user experience **dedicated to a particular application domain**
        like editing a customer or placing an order.

        They typically have a top component that acts as the feature root.
        Private, supporting sub-components descend from it.

        Domain feature module consist mostly of _declarations_.
        Only the top component is exported.

        Domain feature modules rarely have _providers_.
        When they do, the lifetime of the provided services
        should be the same as the lifetime of the module.

        Do not provide application-wide singleton services in a domain feature module.

        Domain feature modules are typically imported _exactly once_ by a larger feature module.

        They might be imported by the root `AppModule` of a small application that lacks routing.

      .l-sub-section
        :marked
          For an example, see [_ContactModule_](../guide/ngmodule.html#contact-module-v1)
          in the Angular Module chapter, before we introduced routing.
  tr
    td(style="vertical-align: top")<a id="routed-feature-module"></a>Routed
    td
      :marked
        _Routed Feature Modules_ are _Domain Feature modules_
        whose top components are the **targets of router navigation routes**.

        All lazy loaded modules are routed feature modules by definition.

        This chapter's `ContactModule`, `HeroModule` and `CrisisModule` are routed feature modules.

        Routed Feature Modules _should not export anything_.
        They don't have to because none of their components ever appear in the template of an external component.

        A lazy loaded Routed Feature Module should _not be imported_ by any module.
        Doing so would trigger an eager load, defeating the purpose of lazy loading.
        `HeroModule` and `CrisisModule` are lazy loaded. They aren't mentioned among the `AppModule` imports.

        But an eager loaded Routed Feature Module must be imported by another module
        so that the compiler learns about its components.
        `ContactModule` is eager loaded and, therefore, is listed among the `AppModule` imports.

        Routed Feature Modules rarely have _providers_ for reasons [explained earlier](#q-why-bad).
        When they do, the lifetime of the provided services
        should be the same as the lifetime of the module.

        Do not provide application-wide singleton services in a routed feature module
        or in a module that the routed module imports.
  tr
    td(style="vertical-align: top")<a id="routing-module"></a>Routing
    td
      :marked
        A [_Routing Module_](../guide/router.html#routing-module) **provides routing configuration** for another module.

        A Routing Module separates routing concerns from its companion module.
        
        It typically:
        * defines routes
        * adds router configuration to the module's `imports`
        * re-exports `RouterModule`
        * adds guard and resolver service providers to the module's `providers`.
        
        The name of the Routing Module should parallel the name of its companion module, using the suffix "Routing".
        For example, `FooModule` in `foo.module.ts` has a routing module named `FooRoutingModule`
        in `foo-routing.module.ts`
        
        If the companion module is the _root_ `AppModule`, 
        the `AppRoutingModule` adds router configuration to its `imports` with `RouterModule.forRoot(routes)`. 
        All other Routing Modules are children that import `RouterModule.forChild(routes)`.

        A Routing Module re-exports the `RouterModule` as a convenience 
        so that components of the companion module have access to 
        router directives such as `RouterLink` and `RouterOutlet`.

        A Routing Module **should not have its own `declarations`!** 
        &nbsp; Components, directives, and pipes are the **responsibility of the feature module**
        not the _routing_ module.

        A Routing Module should _only_ be imported by its companion module.

        The `AppRoutingModule`, `ContactRoutingModule` and `HeroRoutingModule` are good examples.

        _Service Modules_ **provide utility services** such as data access and messaging.

        Ideally they consist entirely of _providers_ and have no _declarations_.
        The `CoreModule` and Angular's `HttpModule` are good examples.

        Service Modules should _only_ be imported by the root `AppModule`.

        Do **not** import them in other feature modules.
        Know what you're doing and why if you deviate from this guideline.

    td
      :marked
        A _Widget Module_ makes **components, directives, and pipes** available to external modules.

        `CommonModule` and `SharedModule` are widget modules.
        Many third party UI component libraries are widget modules.

        A Widget Module should consist entirely of _declarations_, most of them exported.

        A Widget Module should rarely have _providers_.
        Know what you're doing and why if you deviate from this guideline.

        Import Widget Modules in any module whose component templates need the widgets.

  ### What's the difference between Angular and JavaScript Modules?

  Angular and JavaScript are two different yet complementary module systems.

  In modern JavaScript, [every file is a _module_](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html).
  Within each file we write an `export` statement to make parts of the module public:

code-example(format='.').
  export class AppComponent { ... }

:marked
  Then we `import` a part in another module:

code-example(format='.').
  import { AppComponent }  from './app.component';

:marked
  This kind of modularity is a feature of the _JavaScript language_.

  An _Angular Module_ is a feature of _Angular_ itself.

  Angular's `NgModule` also has `imports` and `exports` and they serve a similar purpose.

  We _import_ other Angular modules so we can use their exported classes in component templates.
  We _export_ this Angular module's classes so they can be imported and used by components of _other_ modules.

  The Angular module classes differ from JavaScript module class in three key respects:

  1. An Angular module bounds [_declarable classes_](#q-declarables) only.
  Declarables are the only classes that matter to the [Angular compiler](#q-angular-compiler).

  1. Instead of defining all member classes in one giant file (as in a JavaScript module),
     we list the module's classes in the `@NgModule.declarations` list.

  1. An Angular module can only export the [_declarable classes_](#q-declarables)
  it owns or imports from other modules.
  It doesn't declare or export any other kind of class.

  The Angular Module is also special in another way.
  Unlike JavaScript modules, an Angular module can extend the _entire_ application with services
  by adding providers to the `@NgModule.providers` list.

.alert.is-important
  :marked
    The provided services do not belong to the module nor are they scoped to the declared classes.
    They are available _everywhere_.

:marked
  Here's an _Angular Module_ class with imports, exports, and declarations.
+makeExample('ngmodule/ts/app/contact/contact.module.2.ts', 'class')(format=".")
:marked
  Of course we use _JavaScript_ modules to write _Angular_ modules as seen in the complete `contact.module.ts` file:
+makeExample('ngmodule/ts/app/contact/contact.module.2.ts', '', 'app/contact/contact.module.ts')(format=".")

  How does Angular find components, directives, and pipes in a template?<br>What is a <i><b>template reference</b></i>?
:marked
  The [Angular compiler](#q-angular-compiler) looks inside component templates
  for other components, directives, and pipes. When it finds one, that's a "template reference".

  The Angular compiler finds a component or directive in a template when it can match the **selector** of that
  component or directive to some HTML in that template.

  The compiler finds a pipe if the pipe's **name** appears within the pipe syntax of the template HTML.

  Angular only matches selectors and pipe names for classes that are declared by this module
  or exported by a module that this module imports.

  ### What is the Angular Compiler?

  The _Angular Compiler_ converts the application code we write into highly performant JavaScript code.
  The `@NgModule` metadata play an important role in guiding the compilation process.

  The code we write is not immediately executable.
  Consider **components**.
  Components have templates that contain custom elements, attribute directives, Angular binding declarations,
  and some peculiar syntax that clearly isn't native HTML.

  The _Angular Compiler_ reads the template markup,
  combines it with the corresponding component class code, and emits _component factories_.

  A component factory creates a pure, 100% JavaScript representation
  of the component that incorporates everything described in its `@Component` metadata:
  the HTML, the binding instructions, the attached styles ... everything.

  Because **directives** and **pipes** appear in component templates,
  the _Angular Compiler_ incorporates them into compiled component code too.

  `@NgModule` metadata tells the _Angular Compiler_ what components to compile for this module and
  how to link this module with other modules.

        A list of [declarable](#q-declarables) classes,
        the **component**, **directive** and **pipe** classes that _belong to this module_.

        These declared classes are visible within the module but invisible to
        components in a different module unless (a) they are _exported_ from this module and
        (b) that other module _imports_ this one.

        Components, directives and pipes must belong to _exactly_ one module.
        The compiler emits an error if we try to declare the same class in more than one module.

        **Do not re-declare a class imported from another module.**

  tr
    td(style="vertical-align: top") <code>providers</code>
    td
      :marked
        A list of dependency injection providers.

        Angular registers these providers with the root injector of the module's execution context.
        That's the application's root injector for all modules loaded when the application starts.

        Angular can inject one of these provider services into any component in the application.
        If this module provides the `HeroService`, or any module loaded at launch provides the `HeroService`,
        Angular can inject the same `HeroService` intance into any app component.

        A lazy loaded module has its own sub-root injector which typically
        is a direct child of the application root injector.

        Lazy loaded services are scoped to the lazy module's injector.
        If a lazy loaded module also provides the `HeroService`,
        any component created within that module's context (e.g., by router navigation)
        gets the local instance of the service, not the instance in the root application injector.

        Components in external modules continue to receive the instance created for the application root.

  tr
    td(style="vertical-align: top") <code>imports</code>
    td
      :marked
        A list of supporting modules.

        Specifically, the list of modules whose exported components, directives or pipes
        are referenced by the component templates declared in this module.

        A component template can [reference](#q-template-reference) another component, directive or pipe
        on two conditions: either the referenced class is declared in this module
        or the class was imported from another module.

        A component can use the `NgIf` and `NgFor` directives only because its parent module
        imported the Angular `CommonModule` (perhaps indirectly by importing `BrowserModule`).

        We can import many standard directives with the `CommonModule`.
        But some familiar directives belong to other modules.
        A component template can bind with `[(ngModel)]` only after importing the Angular `FormsModule`.
  tr
    td(style="vertical-align: top") <code>exports</code>
    td
      :marked
        A list of declarations &mdash; **component**, **directive**, and **pipe** classes &mdash; that
        an importing module can use.

        Exported declarations are the module's _public API_.
        A component in another module can [reference](#q-template-reference) _this_ module's `HeroComponent`
        if (a) it imports this module and (b) this module exports `HeroComponent`.

        Declarations are private by default.
        If this module does _not_ export `HeroComponent`, no other module can see it.

        Importing a module does _not_ automatically re-export the imported module's exports.
        Module 'B' can't use `ngIf` just because it imported module `A` which imported `CommonModule`.
        Module 'B' must import `CommonModule` itself.

        A module can list another module among its `exports` in which case
        all of that module's public components, directives, and pipes are exported.

        [Re-export](#q-re-export) makes module transitivity explicit.
        If Module 'A' re-exports `CommonModule` and Module 'B' imports Module 'A',
        Module 'B' components can use `ngIf` even though 'B' itself didn't import `CommonModule`.

  tr
    td(style="vertical-align: top") <code>bootstrap</code>
    td
      :marked
        A list of components that can be bootstrapped.

        Usually there is only one component in this list, the _root component_ of the application.

        Angular can launch with multiple bootstrap components,
        each with its own location in the host web page.

        A bootstrap component is automatically an `entryComponent`

  tr
    td(style="vertical-align: top") <code>entryComponents</code>
    td
      :marked
        A list of components that are _not_ [referenced](#q-template-reference) in a reachable component template.

        Most developers will never set this property. Here's why.

        The [_Angular Compiler_](#q-angular-compiler) must know about every component actually used in the application.
        The compiler can discover most components by walking the tree of references
        from one component template to another.

        But there's always at least one component that is not referenced in any template:
        the root component, `AppComponent`, that we bootstrap to launch the app.
        That's why it's called an _entry component_.

        Routed components are also _entry components_ because they aren't referenced in a template either.
        The router creates them and drops them into the DOM near a `<router-outlet>`.

        While the bootstrapped and routed components are _entry components_,
        we usally don't have to add them to a module's `entryComponents` list.

        Angular automatically adds components in the module's `bootstrap` list to the `entryComponents` list.
        The `RouterModule` adds routed components to that list.

        That leaves only two sources of undiscoverable components.
        1. Components bootstrapped using one of the imperative techniques.
        1. Components dynamically loaded into the DOM by some means other than the router.

        Both are advanced techniques that few developers will ever employ.
        If you are one of those few, you'll have to add these components to the
        `entryComponents` list yourself, either programmatically or by hand.
