  # Angular 2 Cookbooks
  
  The *Cookbook* documentation series offers answers to common implementation questions.
  
  Each cookbook is a collection of recipes focused on a particular Angular 2 feature or application challenge
  such as data binding, cross-component interaction, and communicating with a remote server via HTTP.

    We have one cookbook so far with more on the way.

  Recipes are deliberately brief and code-centric. Each recipe links to a chapter of the Developer Guide or the API Guide
  where you can learn more about the purpose, context, and design choices behind the code snippets.
  
  Each cookbook links to a live sample with every recipe included.
