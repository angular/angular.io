  Good tools make application development quicker and easier to maintain than
  if you did everything by hand.

  The [**Angular CLI**](https://cli.angular.io/) is a **_command line interface_** tool
  that can create a project, add files, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such
  as testing, bundling, and deployment.

  The goal in this guide is to build and run a simple Angular
  application in TypeScript, using the Angular CLI
  while adhering to the [Style Guide](./guide/style-guide.html) recommendations that
  benefit _every_ Angular project.

  By the end of the chapter, you'll have a basic understanding of development with the CLI
  and a foundation for both these documentation samples and for real world applications.

  You'll pursue these ends in the following high-level steps:

  1. [Set up](#devenv) the development environment.
  2. [Create](#create-proj) a new project and skeleton application.
  3. [Serve](#serve) the application.
  4. [Edit](#first-component) the application.

  And you can also <a href="/resources/zips/cli-quickstart/cli-quickstart.zip">download the example.</a>

h2#devenv Step 1. Set up the Development Environment
:marked
  You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

  Install **[Node.js® and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**
  if they are not already on your machine.
.l-sub-section
  :marked
    **Verify that you are running at least node `6.9.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
    by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
    Older versions produce errors, but newer versions are fine.
:marked
  Then **install the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)** globally.

code-example(language="sh" class="code-shell").
  npm install -g @angular/cli

.l-main-section
h2#create-project Step 2. Create a new project
:marked
  Open a terminal window.

:marked
  Generate a new project and skeleton application by running the following commands:

code-example(language="sh" class="code-shell").
  ng new my-app

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    Patience please.
    It takes time to set up a new project, most of it spent installing npm packages.

.l-main-section
h2#serve Step 3: Serve the application
:marked
  Go to the project directory and launch the server.

code-example(language="sh" class="code-shell").
  cd my-app
  ng serve --open

:marked
  The `ng serve` command launches the server, watches your files,
  and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.

  Using the `--open` (or just `-o`) option will automatically open your browser
  on `http://localhost:4200/`.

  Your app greets you with a message:

figure.image-display
  img(src='/resources/images/devguide/cli-quickstart/app-works.png' alt="The app works!")

.l-main-section
h2#first-component Step 4: Edit your first Angular component
:marked
  The CLI created the first Angular component for you.
  This is the _root component_ and it is named `app-root`.
  You can find it in `./src/app/app.component.ts`.

:marked
  Open the component file and change the `title` property from _app works!_ to _My First Angular App_:

+makeExample('cli-quickstart/ts/src/app/app.component.ts', 'title', 'src/app/app.component.ts')(format=".")

:marked
  The browser reloads automatically with the revised title. That's nice, but it could look better.

  Open `src/app/app.component.css` and give the component some style.

+makeExample('cli-quickstart/ts/src/app/app.component.css', null, 'src/app/app.component.css')(format=".")

figure.image-display
  img(src='/resources/images/devguide/cli-quickstart/my-first-app.png' alt="Output of QuickStart app")

:marked
  Looking good!

  ## What's next?
  That's about all you'd expect to do in a "Hello, World" app.

  You're ready to take the [Tour of Heroes Tutorial](./tutorial) and build
  a small application that demonstrates the great things you can build with Angular.

  Or you can stick around a bit longer to learn about the files in your brand new project.

  ## Project file review

  An Angular CLI project is the foundation for both quick experiments and enterprise solutions.

  The first file you should check out is `README.md`.
  It has some basic information on how to use CLI commands.
  Whenever you want to know more about how Angular CLI works make sure to visit
  [the Angular CLI repository](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and
  [Wiki](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki).

  Some of the generated files might be unfamiliar to you.

    ### The `src` folder
    Your app lives in the `src` folder.
    All Angular components, templates, styles, images, and anything else your app needs go here.
    Any files outside of this folder are meant to support building your app.

        Defines the `AppComponent` along with an HTML template, CSS stylesheet, and a unit test.
        It is the **root** component of what will become a tree of nested components
        as the application evolves.
  tr
    td <code>app/app.module.ts</code>
    td
      :marked
        Defines `AppModule`, the [root module](guide/appmodule.html "AppModule: the root module") that tells Angular how to assemble the application.
        Right now it declares only the `AppComponent`.
        Soon there will be more components to declare.
  tr
    td <code>assets/*</code>
    td
      :marked
        A folder where you can put images and anything else to be copied wholesale
        when you build your application.
  tr
    td <code>environments/*</code>
    td
      :marked
        This folder contains one file for each of your destination environments,
        each exporting simple configuration variables to use in your application.
        The files are replaced on-the-fly when you build your app.
        You might use a different API endpoint for development than you do for production
        or maybe different analytics tokens.
        You might even use some mock services.
        Either way, the CLI has you covered.
  tr
    td <code>favicon.ico</code>
    td
      :marked
        Every site wants to look good on the bookmark bar.
        Get started with your very own Angular icon.
  tr
    td <code>index.html</code>
    td
      :marked
        The main HTML page that is served when someone visits your site.
        Most of the time you'll never need to edit it.
        The CLI automatically adds all `js` and `css` files when building your app so you
        never need to add any `&lt;script&gt;` or `&lt;link&gt;` tags here manually.
  tr
    td <code>main.ts</code>
    td
      :marked
        The main entry point for your app.
        Compiles the application with the [JIT compiler](glossary.html#jit)
        and bootstraps the application's root module (`AppModule`) to run in the browser.
        You can also use the [AOT compiler](glossary.html#ahead-of-time-aot-compilation)
        without changing any code by passing in `--aot` to `ng build` or `ng serve`.
  tr
    td <code>polyfills.ts</code>
    td
      :marked
        Different browsers have different levels of support of the web standards.
        Polyfills help normalize those differences.
        You should be pretty safe with `core-js` and `zone.js`, but be sure to check out
        the [Browser Support guide](guide/browser-support.html) for more information.
  tr
    td <code>styles.css</code>
    td
      :marked
        Your global styles go here.
        Most of the time you'll want to have local styles in your components for easier maintenance,
        but styles that affect all of your app need to be in a central place.
  tr
    td <code>test.ts</code>
    td
      :marked
        This is the main entry point for your unit tests.
        It has some custom configuration that might be unfamiliar, but it's not something you'll
        need to edit.
  tr
    td <code>tsconfig.{app|spec}.json</code>
    td
      :marked
        TypeScript compiler configuration for the Angular app (`tsconfig.app.json`)
        and for the unit tests (`tsconfig.spec.json`).

    ### The root folder
    The `src/` folder is just one of the items inside the project's root folder.
    Other files help you build, test, maintain, document, and deploy the app.
    These files go in the root folder next to `src/`.

        Inside `e2e/` live the End-to-End tests.
        They shouldn't be inside `src/` because e2e tests are really a separate app that
        just so happens to test your main app.
        That's also why they have their own `tsconfig.e2e.json`.
  tr
    td <code>node_modules/</code>
    td
      :marked
        `Node.js` creates this folder and puts all third party modules listed in
        `package.json` inside of it.
  tr

    td
      :marked
        Configuration for Angular CLI.
        In this file you can set several defaults and also configure what files are included
        when your project is build.
        Check out the official documentation if you want to know more.
  tr
    td <code>.editorconfig</code>
    td
      :marked
        Simple configuration for your editor to make sure everyone that uses your project
        has the same basic configuration.
        Most editors support an `.editorconfig` file.
        See http://editorconfig.org for more information.

    ### Next Step

    If you're new to Angular, continue on the
    [learning path](guide/learning-angular.html "Angular learning path").
    You can skip the "Setup" step since you're already using the Angular CLI setup.
